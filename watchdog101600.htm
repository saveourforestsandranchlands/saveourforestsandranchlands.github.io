      <blockquote> The lawyer for the Lakeside Ralph’s project has just sent a 

        letter recommending that the project applicants conduct a full Environmental 

        Impact Report (EIR) for the project. Admittedly, this project will greatly 

        impact the traffic and run-off of the area. This project is more suitable 

        for an urban area rather than rural east Lakeside. The letter was received 

        by the Chairman of the Lakeside Planning Group.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>This is encouraging news to SOFAR and our Supporters that wish 

        to hold the line of development at the urban/rural edge. We have held 

        the line against urban sprawl at Alpine, with our success in requiring 

        the Alpine Albertsons proponents to complete an EIR, and now at Lakeside. 

        These areas should not be allowed the intensive, urban development that 

        is more appropriate to El Cajon and La Mesa where urban services currently 

        exist. Another front is Ramona, where the rural/urban edge is at Poway. 

        Approving urban-style projects in Alpine, Lakeside, and Ramona is leap-frog 

        development that will allow urban sprawl to spread into San Diego County’s 

        backcountry.</blockquote>

      <blockquote> The Cleveland National Forest Foundation would like to thank 

        all those who attended the benefit party held at Rancho Samataguma yesterday. 

        They would also like to thank the Browns for graciously allowing them 

        to use the ranch for the party.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>The event was well-attended; the ranch was beautiful; the weather 

        splendid; Michael Soule’s talk was informative and inspiring; the food 

        was delicious; the company was outstanding; and the day was enjoyed by 

        all.</blockquote>

      <blockquote> Thank you from CNFF!</blockquote>
