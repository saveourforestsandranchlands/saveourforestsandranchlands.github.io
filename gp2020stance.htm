      <p><strong>Re: Draft General Plan 2020</strong></p>

      <p>Dear Planning Commission,</p>

      <p>Save Our Forest And Ranchlands (SOFAR) is a grass-roots organization 

        dedicated to the protection of the wilderness, watershed, agricultural, 

        and scenic resources of San Diego County. We are comprised of concerned 

        citizens and experts in the fields of land use, conservation of natural 

        resources, land planning, and biology. We are writing to comment on the 

        draft General Plan 2020. While we have been monitoring the progress of 

        GP 2020 during the entire process, our primary focus has been GPA 96-03 

        and the fate of almost 200,000 acres of priceless backcountry rangelands, 

        wildlands, and watershed. Now, with that situation temporarily resolved, 

        we can turn our focus to the General Plan update.</p>

      <p>We are deeply concerned that the draft 2020 Plan has fundamental problems 

        at the conceptual level and may be headed in exactly the wrong direction 

        to achieve the County&#8217;s oft-stated goals of curbing urban sprawl. 

        The basic problem of the draft 2020 Plan is that it is population-based 

        rather than resource-based. This represents upside down planning. In other 

        words, putting the cart before the horse. Noticeably absent from the draft 

        2020 Plan are any Regional Resource Categories backed up with objective 

        definitions. Regional Resource Categories such as Urban Limit Line, Country 

        Town Boundaries, and Environmentally Constrained Areas which then naturally 

        form the hierarchy of planning goals. </p>

      <p>Since the draft 2020 Plan is primarily concerned with the unincorporated 

        rural part of the County, one should first design a plan to protect the 

        County&#8217;s resources, THEN consider population density. Since a legal 

        General Plan is comprised of seven equal Elements, we suggest that the 

        County update the Open Space and Conservation Elements before the Land 

        Use Element. By updating the Open Space and Conservation Elements, the 

        carrying capacity of the land could more easily be determined.</p>

      <p>In any normal professional planning document, such regional categories 

        with objective definitions should find agreement with agencies and knowledgeable 

        planning officials. Furthermore, such categories and their definitions 

        should be such that reasonable concerned citizens can also find agreement 

        with them. The draft 2020 Plan appears to be completely lacking in such 

        principles, categories, and definitions. Amazingly, in the draft 2020 

        Plan with population targets as the only implementing method, we find 

        undefined land-use designators that are arbitrarily placed on the draft 

        maps. As a result, zoning placement has become incoherent arousing a flood 

        of justified complaints since no one understands why their land is designated 

        as it is. </p>

      <p>An example of this incoherence in the draft 2020 Plan is found in the 

        Cleveland NationalForest area. Everyone, we assume, would agree that a 

        National Forest is an example of a bounded, regional resource of significance. 

        Forest habitat is recognized as having universal wilderness, watershed, 

        recreation, and scenic values. In the case of the Cleveland National Forest, 

        the record shows that regional resource protection was mandated by two-thirds 

        of the County&#8217;s electorate, that the Supervisors endorsed large-lot 

        zoning outside of the Country Town boundaries inside the Forest, and that 

        renowned scientists and resource agencies have advised the establishment 

        of 80-acre minimum lot size outside the Country Towns for resource protection. 

        Unbelievably, the new draft 2020 map completely contravenes the collective 

        wisdom of these experienced professionals and a mandate of the people 

        by placing 2, 4, and 10-acre lot size minimums inside the National Forest. 

      </p>

      <p>This is a prime example of how, despite all evidence to the contrary, 

        undefined land-use categories have been incoherently placed in obviously 

        important resource areas, thus defeating the very purpose of the plan. 

        A contrasting example is the 160-acre minimum lot size found in Monte 

        Vista Ranch, presently a Specific Planning Area within Ramona Planning 

        Area. How is it that an area west of the County Water Authority line and 

        closer to existing infrastructure has 160-acre lot size minimums, yet, 

        at the same time, 2, 4, and 10-acre lot sizes can be found in the National 

        Forest? This same fault is found throughout other areas of the County&#8217;s 

        draft 2020 map. Again, setting a hierarchy of Regional Resource Categories 

        with appropriately linked zoning will solve this incoherent patchwork. 

      </p>

      <p>In fact, the draft 2020 Plan eliminates the Country Town boundaries, 

        Regional Resource Categories, and the Urban Limit Line. There are no infrastructure 

        lines found anywhere on the Alternative 3 map. Surely the line demarcating 

        the division between the areas where water is or will be available and 

        the areas which are groundwater dependent would be reflected in the plan? 

      </p>

      <p>The only regional category of the draft 2020 Plan is the so-called population 

        density standard. The County&#8217;s stated purpose of the 2020 plan is 

        to meet population quotas for the various Planning Areas. The County simply 

        took the projected new inhabitants figure from SANDAG and arbitrarily 

        placed them on a map of the County. The problem with accepting the projected 

        population figure is that the so-called target of 661,000 build-out is 

        itself arbitrary. It is based on the fact that our poorly planned urban 

        areas are suffering from a lack of infrastructure and are incapable of 

        increased density. Thus, by spreading more people in the rural areas, 

        we defeat the purpose of a county-wide plan to invest more dollars to 

        cure infrastructure ills that have created a housing crisis, traffic gridlock, 

        and frequent beach closures. Just when we should be minimizing development 

        of our backcountry and investing in our cities to create vibrancy and 

        livability, the new plan offers the bleak alternative of spreading more 

        development and infrastructure in the backcountry.</p>

      <p>Before we hastily reject the current General Plan, it should be pointed 

        out that, at the conceptual level, it is solidly based and was crafted 

        by professionals. The current General Plan is based on Regional Resource 

        Categories with excellent goals and policies. The current General Plan 

        is a resource-based plan and divides the County into clearly defined categories 

        based on the natural resources, built resources, and infrastructure found 

        on the land. Furthermore, in its goals and policies, it states that future 

        growth be directed to existing urban areas. The fault with the current 

        General Plan does not lie with its goals, policies, or regional categories, 

        but, rather, with FAULTY ZONING designations that do not match the categories; 

        therefore, thwarting the IMPLEMENTATION of the current General Plan. It 

        would be the height of folly to discard the excellent basic structure 

        of this sound General Plan and adopt a new plan without these regional 

        resource categories. </p>

      <p>SOFAR recommends that the Planning Commission recommend to the Board 

        of Supervisors to direct the Department of Planning and Land Use and the 

        hired consultants to retain the current conceptual features of our present 

        General Plan that contains Regional Categories with objective definitions, 

        clearly delineated Country Town boundaries, and an Urban Limit Line. We 

        need new implementing features that will both protect San Diego County&#8217;s 

        precious wilderness, watershed, agricultural, and scenic resources and 

        provide housing for future residents.</p>

      <p>Sincerely,</p>

      <p>Duncan McFetridge<br>

        President</p>
