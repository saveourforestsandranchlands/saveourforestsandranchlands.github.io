      <p> Dear Supervisor Jacob:</p>

      <p> On March 31, 2000 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sent 

        you a letter regarding a proposed General Plan Amendment (and Environmental 

        Impact Report) for rezoning agricultural lands in San Diego County (GPA 

        96-03). In that letter, EPA expressed concern with the proposed rezoning 

        and potential negative environmental effects from significant land use 

        changes. After discussing our letter with the County Planning staff this 

        week, we acknowledge that EPA misinterpreted portions of the EIR and proposed 

        amendment. The purpose of this letter is to clarify our comments and confirm 

        our conversations with your staff. We hope that you will consider these 

        revised comments at your Board hearing on April 5th.</p>

      <p> EPA recognizes that the County&#8217;s intent with GPA 96-03 is to preserve 

        agriculture, not to facilitate residential/commercial development. We 

        understand that the amendment is a downzone (e.g. a decrease in allowable 

        dwelling unit/acre density), not an upzone (as asserted in our 3/31/00 

        letter) since currently Ag20 lands are generally zoned at 1 dwelling unit/8 

        acres. Our concerns about the effects of GPA 96-03 on water quality degradation 

        and habitat destruction have been somewhat alleviated, especially in light 

        on County staff&#8217;s pointing out to us that of the 200,000 acres in 

        question, about 50% are unsuitable for agriculture (or development) due 

        to topography and water constraints, and about 25% of the lands are in 

        public ownership. Furthermore, according to County staff, the recommendation 

        calls for only about 18,000 acres to be at the 1:10 unit to acre ratio, 

        while the remaining acreage would be at 1:40. However, we do want to note 

        that this proposed amendment would still allow an increase in density 

        above existing conditions.</p>

      <p> We remain concerned with the County&#8217;s own conclusion that GPA 

        96-03 is expected to result in significant adverse impacts to the environment, 

        including water and biological resources. It is this concern which prompted 

        EPA&#8217;s letter and continues to hold our interest. GPA 96-03 could 

        lead to low density development, even though further development is not 

        contemplated at this time. While we understand that the General Plan Amendment 

        seeks to preserve agriculture, we are seeing a rapid conversion of agricultural 

        lands to residential and commercial uses in California, creating a significant 

        environmental problem. Where we see conversion of agricultural land, we 

        see loss and/or fragmentation of terrestrial and aquatic habitats, decrease 

        in the region&#8217;s biodiversity, and degradation of water quality from 

        increased pollutant loadings. We hope that this will not be the case in 

        Ag20 lands.</p>

      <p> We appreciate the opportunity to offer comments on this proposed General 

        Plan Amendment. If there are any questions regarding our comments please 

        contact Paul Michel at (415) 744-1999.</p>
