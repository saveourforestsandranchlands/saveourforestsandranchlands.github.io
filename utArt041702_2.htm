      <p>We've lost track of how many times the Board of Supervisors has been 

        shot down in court over its faulty plan to protect agricultural land in 

        San Diego County's back-country. And who knows how many millions of dollars 

        in taxpayers' money was wasted in the supervisors' legal contortions to 

        avoid showing a true picture of how much residential development and environmental 

        damage their proposed agricultural plan would cause? </p>

      <p>But they're at it again. Today, the Board of Supervisors will consider 

        yet another revision to the environmental study of its land- use plan 

        for 250,000 acres of private agricultural land. And, again, the flaws 

        are glaring. </p>

      <p>The latest environmental document concludes that a significant increase 

        in demand for back-country residential development is unlikely, an astonishing 

        claim in a county where housing demand is rocketing upward. What's more, 

        the methodology used to gauge the environmental impact of the plan has 

        been labeled &quot;simply bad&quot; by local biology professors. </p>

      <p>For decades, the county has been doing back-flips trying to justify a 

        land-use plan that claims to preserve agriculture acreage while in reality 

        paving the way for development. But every time planning officials are 

        challenged in court, the nonprofit group Save Our Forests and Ranchlands 

        (SOFAR) shoots holes in their environmental studies, and a judge rules 

        against the county. </p>

      <p>In 1996, Judge Judith McConnell found that the county's stewardship of 

        agricultural lands was so inept that she declared a building moratorium 

        and awarded land-use control of the 250,000 acres to SOFAR. Today, if 

        you live on that land and want to do a room addition, you apply to SOFAR 

        for a permit, not the county. </p>

      <p>In the past six years, the county has lost three major court decisions 

        and many smaller judgments as well. San Diego County residents should 

        be furious that their elected leaders have lost their land-use authority 

        for six years because of their own dereliction. But that's what has happened. 

        And this latest attempt probably won't change things. </p>

      <p>&quot;There is not likely to be a significant increase in the demand 

        for residential development within (agricultural) lands once the moratorium 

        is lifted and the Plan Amendment is implemented,&quot; the county's latest 

        environmental document reads. The implication is that nobody needs to 

        worry about increased development because there's little demand for development. 

        What utter nonsense. </p>

      <p>Meanwhile, the methodology for gauging environmental impacts consists 

        of developing a theoretical, one-size-fits-all footprint for what a typical 

        residential home and lot might be, and dividing biological resources such 

        as endangered plants evenly among each theoretical lot. Then, county researchers 

        studied those theoretical lots to determine the impact of the agricultural 

        plan. Biology professors Ted Case of UCSD and Jay Diffendorfer of SDSU 

        called that approach &quot;so at odds with what we feel well-trained biologists 

        would perform that we can only conclude political or other influences 

        warped their methods.&quot; </p>

      <p>The supervisors should abandon this agricultural plan, which clearly 

        cannot pass scientific muster. If supervisors want large- scale residential 

        development in the back-country, they should say so. But if they really 

        want to protect agriculture and natural resources, they need to adopt 

        planning and zoning rules that will actually do it. <br>
