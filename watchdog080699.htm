      <Blockquote>The hearing before the Planning Commission for GPA 96-03 has 

        been postponed, again, to, tentatively, January 21, 2000. The reason for 

        the postponement is that new information is being sought to add to the 

        EIR. This is based on response to the letters of public comment. A couple 

        of sections of the EIR are involved, and, with the new information, either 

        the affected sections or the entire EIR will have to be recirculated. 

        We will keep you posted.</Blockquote>

      <p><u><font size=2><strong>BARONA CASINO/HWY. 67 ACCESS ROAD</strong></font></u></p>

      <Blockquote>We have filed under the Public Records Act for information on 

        the feasibility study being conducted by the County into constructing 

        an access road to Barona Casino from Highway 67. The casino is located 

        on the Barona Indian Reservation on Wildcat Canyon Road between Lakeside 

        and Ramona. The proposed road will either go south or north of San Vicente 

        Reservoir. If it goes north, it will impact Boulder Oaks Ranch, a 1,000-acre 

        plus ranch that is in the process of being acquired for open space under 

        the County's Multiple Species Conservation Plan. It will also impact an 

        1,100-acre parcel owned by the Boy's and Girl's Club that is in the process 

        of being acquired by the State of California Department of Parks and Recreation.</Blockquote> </TD>
