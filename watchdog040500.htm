      <blockquote>At today’s Board of Supervisors’ hearing, the Board voted to 

        adopt GPA 96-03. The vote was 3 in favor (Roberts, Slater, and Cox) with 

        2 abstaining (Horn and Jacob). This decision was based on an illegal EIR 

        and was unsupported by any evidence. SOFAR is looking carefully at how 

        to proceed. </blockquote>

      <p>SOFAR would like to thank the seventeen conservation groups that endorsed 

        the SOFAR Alternative to GPA 96-03: the Sierra Club, Buena Vista & Palomar 

        Audubon Societies, California Native Plant Society, Center for Biological 

        Diversity, Environmental Health Coalition, Surfrider Foundation, San Diego 

        Baykeeper, California Oaks Foundation, Mountain Lion Foundation, Mountain 

        Defense League, Backcountry Coalition, Preserve Wild Santee, Save South 

        Bay, Volcan Mountain Preserve Foundation, Friends of Los Penasquitos Canyon 

        Preserve, and Friends of Julian. We would also like to thank our loyal 

        SOFAR supporters for all your help and support.</p>
