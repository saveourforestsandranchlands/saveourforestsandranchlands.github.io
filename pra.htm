    <TD> <p>WE WON! San Diego activists won a decisive victory for open government 

        in the Rural Heritage &amp; Watershed Initiative Committee lawsuit against 

        the County of San Diego Board of Supervisors for withholding documents 

        regarding RHWI.</p>

      <p>The lawsuit, filed under the Public Records Act, asked the Superior Court 

        to order the Board of Supervisors to reveal a number of documents providing 

        evidence of the County's electioneering effort to thwart RHWI, or 

        Prop B, an important citizen's initiative to stop urban sprawl. 

        RHWI lawyers had sought these documents to show bias on the part of high-ranking 

        public officials regarding Prop B. This represents the beginning of the 

        unveiling of the special interests that have long controlled the County 

        government. </p>

      <p>&quot;The public has a right to know if the Board of Supervisors, controlled 

        by special interests, used their office to fight against one of the most 

        important growth management initiatives in the history of San Diego County&quot;, 

        states Duncan McFetridge, Chairman of the RHWI Committee.</p>

      <p>The last group of documents was ordered to be turned over to the RHWI 

        Committee by Judge Pate of the Superior Court during a brief trial on 

        October 25, 1999. These four documents include communications to Board 

        members from their aides as well as handwritten notes by Supervisor Horn 

        regarding RWHI. The judge will rule on Thursday, October 28, 1999 whether 

        or not the handwritten notes by Supervisor Horn also should be disclosed.</p>
