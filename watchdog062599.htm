      <p><b><u><font size="2">Valley Center Septic Moratorium &amp; POLICY I-78 

        WAIVER</font></u></b></p>

      <blockquote>Good News — The Board of Supervisors on June 16<sup>th</sup> 

        lifted the septic system moratorium for the central portion of Valley 

        Center but left intact Policy I-78. Policy I-78 deals with small wastewater 

        treatment plants. This policy requir es that any small wastewater treatment 

        plant be located within one mile of the urban limit line. Projects outside 

        of that limit must seek a waiver of this policy. It was proposed that 

        Valley Center be granted a blanket waiver of Policy I-78 because of hig 

        h groundwater. Arguments were made by SOFAR that such a waiver would have 

        enormous growth-inducing impacts and set a precedent for the rest of the 

        County. The Department of Planning and Land Use recommended that the septic 

        system moratorium be lifted, wit h applications for septic systems still 

        subject to Department of Environmental Health regulations, and that a 

        blanket waiver of Policy I-78 for Valley Center <u>not</u> be granted. 

        This was the environmentally superior alternative offered in the EIR for 

        t he project. This was the alternative adopted by the Board. This is a 

        sizeable victory for the Backcountry.</blockquote>
