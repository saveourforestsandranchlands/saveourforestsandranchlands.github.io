    <TD> <p><strong><font size="3">The Plastic Greens, Part 2: High Stakes Poker</font></strong></p>

      <p><font size="4"><strong>by Susan Davis</strong></font></p>

      <p>When last we looked in on the Plastic Greens, we were tracing the relationship 

        between the Endangered Habitats League's origins and activities, and their 

        corporate foundation funding. The League has played a major role in establishing 

        Natural Communities Conservation Planning, an end run around the Endangered 

        Species Act based on the premise that real estate development on the Southern 

        California scale can be harmonized with biodiversity and a healthy environment. 

        Using what are essentially giant Habitat Conservation Plans, the policy 

        allows developers to destroy threatened and endangered species if they 

        provide so-called mitigation by adding land to sprawling, interconnected 

        wildlife preserves. Some of the mitigation has been scams, double-dipping 

        or fakery, and in the process, the Endangered Species Act has been nearly 

        eviscerated.</p>

      <p>Chief Executive Officer Dr. Dan Silver runs the League out of Los Angeles, 

        and Michael Beck directs its San Diego operations. It is important to 

        note that the League works with hundreds of thousands of dollars of public 

        money: it is a tax-exempt charitable trust and its revenues are tax-deductible 

        gifts and donations, much of it from the Hewlett and Irvine Foundations..</p>

      <p>As a result of Beck's and Silver's efforts, San Diego, with its three 

        conservation plans -- one in the City, one i n the North County, and one 

        in the Southeastern County -- is being held up as a national model of 

        how to do environmental preservation. The whole Multiple Species Conservation 

        Plan saga in the City is one sad, messy story, usually presented in the 

        press as a &quot;win-win&quot; solution. </p>

      <p>But there's good news. Committed activists like the Center for Biodiversity, 

        Spirit of the Sage Council, and California Native Plant Society are battling 

        the planning process in the courts, and they have a good shot at winning 

        their suits. League-free groups like Save Our Forests and Ranchlands are 

        winning big county-wide land-use battles the old-fashioned way, without 

        foundation grants or paid staffers. San Diego County is in turmoil over 

        backcountry zoning, traffic, and water, and for the first time in a long 

        time it's not the bland leading the blonde. There's some room to move 

        away from the &quot;collaborative conflict resolution&quot; favored by 

        big real estate, Pete Wilson, Bill Clinton and Bruce Babbitt, and toward 

        real change and accountability.</p>

      <p align="center"><strong>High stakes table</strong></p>

      <p>So here's the story of San Diego's MSCP, and an accounting of what Hewlett 

        and Irvine got for their money. In the early 1990s, the Endangered Habitats 

        League petitioned to be invited to the NCCPs' negotiating tables as &quot;stakeholders,&quot; 

        to make decisions about where to allow development and the destruction 

        of animals, plants and habitats, and where and how to &quot;mitigate&quot; 

        the damage. Duncan McFetridge, president of Save Our Forests and Ranchlands, 

        and an incorrigible resister of compromises, insisted from the beginning 

        that this was &quot;a developer-driven plan, not a conservation plan.&quot; 

      </p>

      <p>McFetridge is also proud owner of an unabbreviated Oxford English Dictionary, 

        and he tells me the word &quot;stakeholder&quot; is a gambling term. It 

        means people who have enough money or backing to be dealt into the game. 

        And that's how the City's Multiple Species Conservation Plan unfolded: 

        the big boys split the deck with the agencies, and the enviros were dealt 

        low cards or allowed to look over each others' shoulders. The Mayor's 

        office, the Building Industry Association and development companies (holding 

        five aces), Fish and Wildlife, the San Diego Association of Governments, 

        San Diego Gas and Electric, and the transportation and water districts, 

        were joined by the Sierra Club, the Audubon Society, and the California 

        Native Plant Society, among others. The Endangered Habitats League anted 

        up, too. </p>

      <p>In spite of heavy builders' representation, a developer front group with 

        the smarmy name Alliance for Habitat Conservation also pulled up a chair. 

        Early in the process, Alliance president James Whalen made a telling remark 

        to EarthFirst! Journal: &quot;This isn't about science,&quot; he told 

        Craig Benneville, &quot;its about politics. The building industry is going 

        to fight for every acre it can get.&quot; An honest moment! By contrast, 

        Audubon, the Sierra Club, and others earnestly sat in, thinking they were 

        working within the system while the system was working them. </p>

      <p align="center"><strong>One-eyed Jacks</strong></p>

      <p>In the beginning of the planning process, these contending parties had 

        to lay out the dimensions of the land to be preserved, the goals and principles 

        of preservation, and the goals, principles and land to be sacrificed. 

        This first set of negotiations took nearly five years, from 1991 to 1996, 

        cost millions of dollars, and identified lands adding up to 172,000 acres, 

        and affecting nearly 900 square miles. In the early phases of the planning, 

        Jim Peugh of San Diego Audubon helped represent his organization in the 

        negotiations. In the beginning, he says, &quot;it didn't seem like a bad 

        thing....It looked like something could come out of it,&quot; especially 

        since the MSCP claimed to preserve communities of flora and fauna by acquiring 

        whole areas, rather than saving one species at a time. </p>

      <p>Then the Multiple Species Conservation Plan went into implementation, 

        and that was when the real deals were struck and the rules crafted. Suddenly, 

        one-eyed jacks were wild. &quot;The fine cutting came in the last two 

        years. There was a lot of give and take, and a lot of horse-trading, &quot; 

        says Jim Peugh, and he doesn't mean &quot;give and take&quot; in a positive 

        way. As it shook out, Endangered Habitats League ended up representing 

        most of the other environmentalists at the table. Rolfe and Peugh and 

        others think that they probably let Silver and Beck do too much of the 

        negotiating. There was a funny way, says one observer, in which EHL acted 

        both as clients and as brokers. Beck and Silver didn't always consult, 

        and didn't always report back, but people said &quot;They have the time 

        and energy to do it, and we're overwhelmed.&quot; (Recall where their 

        time and energy came from.) &quot;They seem pretty good at it. Let them 

        do it.&quot; </p>

      <p align="center"><strong>Fancy footwork</strong></p>

      <p>But environmentalists were less worried about Beck's negotiating skills 

        than they were about how the City's plan was actually being crafted. Talented 

        scientists, both in Fish and Wildlife and on contract, were submitting 

        data, field reports, and recommendations, only to have them ignored in 

        the developer-dominated process. Ellen Bauder, vernal pool conservation 

        committee chair of the California Native Plant Society and a nationally 

        respected plant ecologist teaching at San Diego State University, had 

        done a lot of the baseline data collection, as well as hypothesis testing, 

        on rare plants, especially in the wetlands called vernal pools. Vernal 

        pools are small depressions in the earth over hardpan; they fill with 

        water after winter rains and are home to a vivid range of rare and delicate 

        plants, animals and invertebrates. In San Diego, vernal pools are typically 

        on the mesa tops coveted by real estate investors, so they were of great 

        concern. And she did other background surveying as well, coordinating 

        her information with Fish and Wildlife. But, Bauder says, while she was 

        working with the agencies and The Nature Conservancy (now involved as 

        a land broker) to come up with a biologically sound and politically acceptable 

        solution, &quot;they [the stakeholders and The Nature Conservancy] would 

        be wheeling and dealing....I'd identify a critical place, and then I'd 

        find that TNC had already been negotiating with the landowner.&quot; Bauder 

        sent detailed and well-informed comments, queries and reports demanding 

        to know the criteria for the deals, but concluded that TNC wasn't representing 

        the natural resources well, and &quot;science wasn't being followed in 

        the negotiations. I finally decided it was no longer worth my while to 

        offer expertise and comments.&quot; Worse, &quot;by saying they had consulted 

        me, they could imply that they had somehow incorporated my knowledge when 

        they had not used it at all.&quot; Ironically, Bauder had been a board 

        member of the California Nature Conservancy, but spilt with the organization 

        when it reorganized to pull in more corporate support in the 1980s. </p>

      <p>Allison Rolfe, now Executive Director of San Diego Audubon, wrote a thesis 

        on the MSCP for her master's degree in Geography at San Diego State. After 

        studying every step of the process she had felt hope for, she's concluded 

        that the MSCP, like a changeling, &quot;is what ever it wants to be.&quot; 

        &quot;The collaborative process, it's all political negotiation. You've 

        got too many conflicting issues at stake, and so the stakeholders can 

        only agree on things that are meaningless. They agree on statements like 

        &quot;We will avoid vernal pools to the maximum extent practicable.&quot; 

        Allison is exercised. &quot;To the public, that sounds good! But from 

        my point of view, as a wetlands activist, that means nothing. Nothing! 

        This is a permitting program. You are planning to issue a permit. So, 

        when will you impact them and which ones will you impact? &quot;</p>

      <p>She catches her breath. &quot;The political problem is, if they wanted 

        to give us that information, they couldn't, because the Building Industry 

        Association is at the table. They and the other stakeholders will not 

        be tied down. That's why they are at the table: to make sure they have 

        room to wiggle out of protection.&quot; The city had a thorough and accurate 

        survey of the vernal pools that documented profound loss. Planners went 

        ahead and made the political decision that some pools could be sacrificed, 

        and some saved. Even if greens agreed with such a cynical act, how would 

        the choices be made? If planners made the choice on the basis of biological 

        integrity, and let &quot;the owner of degraded pools develop, the owner 

        of high quality pools is going to go nuts!&quot; Rolfe watched the city 

        try a different tack. &quot;They said &quot;We'll protect 88% of the vernal 

        pools.&quot; But where does the 88% come from? Which 12% are gonna get 

        hit? Is it 88% of the pools' historical range? Or is it 88% of the 3% 

        of all of California's original vernal pools that we have left now? .... 

        I never thought they even had 12% they could afford give away.&quot; Rolfe 

        and Ellen Bauder asked many times what the City was preserving 88% of, 

        but the City played it close to the vest and they never got answers. Preservation 

        by percentages makes no sense in the world of plant biology, anyway, Bauder 

        says, because rare plants are cyclical, seasonal and, in their embryonic 

        forms, often not visible for years at a time. Rolfe says, &quot;I kept 

        saying, we're going to have to sue.&quot;</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, according to another interviewee, Rolfe and her allies were 

        told by Michael Beck to lay off the vernal pools issue, because &quot;it 

        was really pissing people off.&quot;</p>

      <p>For another made-up number, take the celebrated 85 rare and sensitive 

        plants and animals the San Diego City plan is supposed to save. &quot;That's 

        just a number they made up,&quot; laughs Rolfe. What? I thought it was 

        the result of a survey, or, well, something. &quot;Actually, San Diego 

        County has as many as 200 to 300 sensitive species already listed or with 

        potential for threatened and endangered status. The MSCP claims to adequately 

        conserve 85. But as a measure of what was needed, 85 was just a conjectural 

        number that's become a fact. At one point there was a stand off between 

        the developers' numbers and and the biologists' numbers. They didn't match 

        at all.&quot; The lucky number 85 was probably due to some under-the-table 

        card passing by the developers. Really, Rolfe says, there may be a lot 

        of plants, even animals, we don't suspect are out there. There's that 

        much land, that much diversity, and sound biological surveys are a mountain 

        of expensive work.</p>

      <p align="center"><strong>Pass me those dice....</strong></p>

      <p>Ted Case, a UCSD biology professor and world-famous herpetologist was 

        very interested in the MSCP from the beginning, not least because he thought 

        it was going to be so geographically big that it might make some interesting 

        research possible. Case is a soft-spoken, funny and gentle man, so it 

        takes a while for the implications of what he's telling me to sink in. 

        He says that if you collected baseline data on endangered species, set 

        aside huge preserves, and then carefully monitored and collected information 

        from the preserves for, say, fifty or a hundred years, &quot;you'd have 

        something really interesting to work with&quot; to understand extinction 

        and recovery. Especially recovery, which, he points out, scientists don't 

        have a handle on. But, Case says, it was clear to him from the beginning 

        that there was &quot;a gear missing somewhere.&quot; </p>

      <p>&quot;Everyone was aware that there was no entity to coordinate the monitoring 

        and management of the biological activity in the NCCP and MSCP.&quot; 

        If you want to know whether species are really recovering, or even holding 

        steady, data has to be collected at the right scale, and using methods 

        to assure comparability. &quot;For example, monitoring gnatcatchers in 

        Poway should be comparable to monitoring gnatcatchers in Otay.&quot; But 

        it was clear to Case from the beginning that this was never going to be 

        allowed. &quot;There was sentiment,&quot; he says, putting it in his tactful 

        academic way, &quot;that that would be unpalatable to local governments. 

        It would be big government. I was at a meeting where it was suggested 

        [that we plan for coordinated monitoring] and everyone just looked very 

        uncomfortable.&quot; From the stakeholder's point of view, scientists 

        like Case weren't there to offer expertise: they were just gamblers, too, 

        and they were playing against the house.</p>

      <p>Let me put it in my untactful way: from the point of view of the developers, 

        systematic and coordinated monitoring (&quot;big government&quot;) might 

        shuffle their stacked deck. But from the gnatcatcher's, or any rare animal 

        or plant's point of view, it could be essential. Under the Endangered 

        Species Act, monitoring and management are required. Ted Case thinks that 

        there may be monitoring and management records from the last several years 

        of the MSCP somewhere, but he's an experienced researcher and he's not 

        able to find anyone who knows where they are. &quot;They just never set 

        up an organizational structure.&quot;</p>

      <p>Then there was the royal flush: the &quot;No Surprises&quot; clause. 

        Developers nation-wide demanded it, and Bill Clinton delivered it in an 

        amendment to the ESA. &quot;No Surprises&quot; means that no matter what 

        happens to a plant or animal, or to its environment, or in the realm of 

        science, once a landowner has signed on with the MSCP there can be no 

        further limits on their right to develop their land. All further burdens 

        for recovery measures fall on the government and, therefore, on the public. 

        Case points out US Fish and Wildlife and California Fish and Game, the 

        same agencies charged with monitoring the success of the MSCP, are also 

        stuck with the expense of recovery if it fails. Quite a conflict, Ted 

        Case suggests. Bad hand, I'd say.</p>

      <p>San Diego's greens were outraged by &quot;No Surprises&quot;. Spirit 

        of the Sage Council in Orange County is leading the suit against it. Beck 

        and Silver, of course, argued then and argue now that developers have 

        to be given reasonable incentives to be at the table, and this was one. 

        &quot;You just don't do [these plans] without landowner assurances,&quot; 

        insists Beck. &quot;It is not possible....The principle is that we are 

        all part of the problem, and we all need to pay for many years of bad 

        decision making.&quot; What is this, the theory of collective guilt? We're 

        going to pay developers not to break the law? Has the San Diego County 

        Association of Taxpayers heard about this?</p>

      <p>&quot;Well, we don't support the use of No Surprises,&quot; says Beck 

        heatedly. &quot;No Surprises&quot; was critical to the developers, and 

        they didn't fight for it not to use it.</p>

      <p>&quot;No Surprises&quot; is not just a theoretical problem. For a real-life 

        scenario, Ellen Bauder points to the recent New York Times report that 

        tanoak in Central California are being devastated by a mysterious and 

        fast spreading &quot;sudden oak death&quot; syndrome. Now there's a surprise 

        for you! What if sudden death syndrome spreads to the rare oaks protected 

        in the giant, Southern California HCPs, and protection of the woodlands 

        and their associated wildlife on developer land is needed? Does Beck really 

        think the building industry won't invoke &quot;No Surprises&quot;? And 

        this is only one of a score of real life surprises coming up.</p>

      <p align="center"><br>

        <strong>House of cards</strong></p>

      <p>The other thing that the ESA requires of a Habitat Conservation Plan 

        is an identified budget and a funding source. San Diego didn't have that 

        either, and still doesn't. This was one more reason some field scientists 

        who worked hard on the MSCP gave up and went away. Case the herpetologist 

        says &quot;All the advisory committees I've been on end in nothing, because 

        they start with the presumption that there's no money. We've also tried 

        working from overarching first principles [of conservation science], but 

        the Building Industry Association, or City people, or agency people -- 

        none of them want the bill, so the discussion goes nowhere. I just quit 

        going.&quot; </p>

      <p>Then there is the famous issue of connectivity. The giant preserves are 

        supposed to allow wildlife migration for animals and dispersal for plants. 

        San Diego County's preserves are supposed to be connected not only to 

        each other, but to public lands, and to the preserves in Orange and Riverside 

        counties. But the pace of destruction has been so fast, and participation 

        so voluntary that the connections are weak. &quot;The most ridiculous 

        example of fake corridors was the one on Otay Mesa,&quot; says Ellen Bauder. 

        &quot;It is a 200 ft.-long concrete pipe, 6 ft. in diameter.&quot; At 

        the Carmel Mountain developments on the coast, only one passway now connects 

        a creekbeds and a mesa with an estuary -- it is a low, cramped route under 

        a fifteen lane freeway, which then crosses two-lane Sorrento Valley road, 

        now closed. Despite MSCP mandates for linkages, the City is proposing 

        to reopen the road for commuters to a local high-tech district. So much 

        for connectivity. </p>

      <p>Michael Beck is proud of the fact that he spent two years working to 

        save an area called Crestridge, between El Cajon and Alpine. 2,600 acres 

        was vested for development, and mapped for 95 houses. With a &quot;bridge 

        loan&quot; from The Nature Conservancy, the state acquired Crestridge 

        for the MSCP. &quot;There was no leverage, just trust and personal relationships,&quot; 

        says Beck. &quot;Crestridge is important,&quot; says Duncan McFetridge 

        of the hard-fighting Save Our Forests and Ranchlands. &quot;No question 

        about it, it is very valuable in natural and wildlife terms.&quot; McFetridge 

        doesn't say positive things about Beck very often, but here he gives credit. 

        But there's another but. Crestridge is supposed to link to a corridor 

        from the southern lobe of the central preserve to the northern edge of 

        the county's southern preserve. The corridor the wildlife is supposed 

        to use passes south under Interstate 8, crosses a two lane asphalt highway, 

        and heads straight into a sheer, 300 ft vertical rock face. There's a 

        stop sign and a bus stop at the corner. McFetridge often shows a slide 

        of this spot at political meetings, and he jokes that, luckily, the wildlife 

        that can't make it up the cliff can catch the bus. &quot;I even get laughs 

        from the Building Industry boys on that one!&quot; I-8 severs the two 

        preserves absolutely, and Crestridge is meaningless if you can't get up 

        that cliff. </p>

      <p>All these worries and more forced the sincere hearts in the San Diego 

        environmental community to oppose the adoption of the Multiple Species 

        Conservation Plan by the City Council. Beck and the League had long since 

        emerged as the responsible environmentalists, the ones who wouldn't make 

        anyone powerful feel uncomfortable. Audubon's Jim Peugh says, &quot; Finally, 

        everything just came apart. The people from the agencies were cheery and 

        encouraging. They didn't see why we just couldn't understand how great 

        it would be. But accountability wasn't adequate, so we just couldn't support 

        it.&quot; Allison Rolfe, then representing the Southwest Center for Biodiversity, 

        says &quot;I griped for a couple of years, saying it's not specific enough, 

        it's not in compliance with the ESA, there's no accountability, and no 

        sanctions&quot; for violators. The City just kept saying &quot;trust us.&quot; 

        In the end, San Diego Audubon came out against the MSCP, but California 

        Audubon sent letters of support. That was a bitter betrayal, says Peugh. 

        &quot;After that I just wanted to move somewhere where no one had ever 

        heard the word MSCP.&quot; California Native Plant Society and the Southwest 

        Center opposed the plan for offering inadequate protection of wildlife 

        and the land. Save Our Forests sent letters urging rejection. The Sierra 

        Club and Endangered Habitats League supported it. There was so much contention 

        that, at the final council meeting, Building Industry Association representatives 

        wore badges that said &quot;Save the MSCP!&quot; </p>

      <p>Today, the first two steps of planning and approval are well along. The 

        process of land acquisition is expected to take decades, and the money's 

        still not all there. No one knows what's happening with perpetual management 

        and monitoring, but the money's not there for that either. &quot;If you 

        think about it,&quot; says one activist, &quot;it was a Ponzi scheme.&quot; 

        A first group of players (the developers and public officials) chipped 

        in --- time, money, pressure, and that all-important ingredient, publicity. 

        Their stake in turn convinced the next group, the greens, to ante up their 

        time and credibility so the project could move on to the next phase, which 

        in turn convinced the third group, the public, to chip in by ratifying 

        it. In a classic Ponzi, the last ones in take the greatest risk. And as 

        in a classic Ponzi, there wasn't much there. San Diego might acquire some 

        land it otherwise would not have, may be some nice park land, says UCSD 

        biologist Michael Gilpin, who sat on some early advisory panels. But from 

        the point of view of species recovery -- and again, we're talking hundreds 

        of species -- it's a house of cards. </p>

      <p align="center"><br>

        <strong>Things fall apart</strong></p>

      <p>After San Diego's Multiple Species Conservation Plan was adopted in April, 

        1997, the feathers really hit the fan. The first disaster was the bulldozing 

        in late 1999 of 62 vernal pools for a shopping mall called Cousins Marketplace 

        on Mira Mesa. Although the pools were supposed to be avoided under the 

        MSCP, the city council issued Cousins a take permit allowing their destruction, 

        and Mayor Susan Golding signed off on it. &quot;The site was not the most 

        pristine pools, but it was very good&quot; sighs Allison Rolfe. They had 

        &quot;very notable biological diversity, and there were 62 of them, so 

        they were functioning as a complex. They were connected to [the open lands 

        of] Miramar Naval Air Station&quot; which has (or had) its own pools, 

        so there was connectivity. I tell Allison I didn't even know there were 

        vernal pools in Mira Mesa: to me it's all one big commercial strip. There's 

        an Old Navy and a huge parking lot there now. &quot;We didn't even have 

        a chance to know it before it was gone,&quot; she says.</p>

      <p>Michael Beck gets hot under the collar at the notion that the Cousins 

        pools incident reveals a big problem with the MSCP. Endangered Habitats 

        League had argued against the take permit. &quot;That's not the MSCP's 

        fault, that's the implementer's fault,&quot; he rails. Allison Rolfe bristles 

        back: &quot;He's wrong, and he knows it. If you give the city that much 

        flexibility in the MSCP, and they use it, is it their fault? Flexibility 

        was built into the MSCP. Golding knew it was wrong, but she did it anyway.&quot; 

        Rolfe recalls that during the MSCP planning process, when she'd raise 

        objections about developer prerogatives and the lack of specificity about 

        what could be &quot;taken,&quot; city staffers and planners would tell 

        her &quot;just trust us, we'll do the right thing. &quot; &quot;In a perfect 

        world, &quot; Rolfe fumes, &quot;it'd be great to trust politicians and 

        decision makers. But Cousins is exactly what we foresaw in the wiggly, 

        discretionary language.&quot; </p>

      <p>It's not only the loose language. On any given day, one or another of 

        San Diego's City Council members is under investigation for some scam 

        or other, by one Attorney General or District Attorney or another. The 

        current investigators are from the FBI and they're looking into -- guess 

        what -- real estate developers and alleged council vote-buying. Susan 

        Golding, everyone likes to remember to forget, is the ex-wife of a convicted 

        money launderer. (She threw him overboard before becoming mayor.) And 

        this is a city that in 1997 closed its Planning and Environmental Services 

        Department, then reopened it as the Department of Development and Economic 

        Services. You get the idea who runs the San Diego cardroom. I wouldn't 

        trust this crew with a quarter for my parking meter. </p>

      <p>What does Endangered Habitats League's Dan Silver have to say about the 

        San Diego deal he and Beck brokered? &quot;Overall, we're strong supporters 

        of it. There are flaws, but the city and the county are on track [with 

        their differently phased parts of the plan.] It has had some bumps...and 

        some bad deals were made in MSCP developments.&quot; He cites Carmel Mountain 

        (a disaster I wrote about in Counterpunch earlier this year), and a huge 

        development called Fanita Ranch, a giant subdivision MSCP'd out in the 

        east county near Santee. Fanita Ranch was so bad that the residents of 

        Santee and Lakeside stopped it this spring with a ballot initiative. &quot;The 

        people became upset, realized it was bad, and made it better,&quot; says 

        Silver. Right. Through the democratic process, Save Wild Santee knocked 

        over the deck Silver and Beck helped stack.</p>

      <p>What about the funding problems? &quot;Well, the MSCP program is starved 

        for funds. The regional funding source never materialized. But Proposition 

        12 will help that.&quot; The &quot;regional funding source&quot; Beck 

        refers to is required by law, and I suspect it might be the countywide 

        Transportation Tax money that the Mayor, with EHL and The Nature Conservancy, 

        recently tried divert to open space acquisition. (One third of this money 

        currently goes to new roads, one third to repairs and one third to badly 

        needed public transportation.) The City passed the MSCP without the federally 

        mandated funding in place, is about to be in default, and is being sued 

        over this. The City is desperate, so Golding sent Silver to lobby for 

        a last minute extension of the tax and a major reallocation of the proceeds. 

        The San Diego Association of Governments (the regional transportation 

        authority) was perplexed by this maneuver and told Mayor Golding and Dan 

        Silver to get lost. Silver reportedly hectored the dumbfounded SANDAG 

        officials: &quot;You really disappoint me!&quot; Clearly this guy thinks 

        he's running the game.</p>

      <p>As for Proposition 12, this spring's statewide bond initiative to fund 

        parks and safe neighborhoods has a budget line in it for wildlife habitat 

        acquisition. The Endangered Habitats League's 1999 tax return shows that 

        they hired a lobbyist that year, and I'm only guessing, but I'd bet he 

        or she was working in Sacramento to make sure that some of that bond money 

        flowed in the MSCP's direction. Knowingly or not, California voters may 

        have ponied up some money for the MSCP hustle.</p>

      <p>The MSCP was supposed to be part of the movement to get big government 

        off people's backs, and so it gave the enforcement of environmental law 

        to the local authorities. Allison Rolfe registers what's been lost: &quot;For 

        almost ten years, we at the Southwest Center for Biodiversity were effectively 

        holding federal agencies accountable in court. Now we can't do that anymore, 

        because it is the City that is accountable.&quot; It was hard enough to 

        sue the feds, but now they have to sue the city &quot;on a project by 

        project basis.&quot; Of course, an end to piece by piece, species by species 

        litigation was supposed to be a big benefit of the MSCP. It's had a different 

        effect. &quot;It's so much more difficult, because you have to sue on 

        the MSCP, and no one knows how that's going to work. The process by which 

        we can sue has been clouded. If there's a problem, Fish and Wildlife blames 

        it on the City, and the City blames it on Fish and Wildlife. How do we 

        figure out who's at fault and explain that to a judge?&quot; Rolfe is 

        in there battling: she is the lead plaintiff, with the Southwest Center, 

        in a suit against the MSCP's destruction of wetlands. Cousins Marketplace 

        is Exhibit A. She is joined by thirteen other local and national groups, 

        prominently not including the Endangered Habitats League. </p>

      <p>Where does Rolfe think the MSCP is right now, in terms of preserving 

        San Diego's biodiversity? Could it be working, despite what Dan Silver 

        calls &quot;bumps?&quot; &quot;It's hard to answer. The past was bad, 

        and this might be better. But we are losing so much, so quickly my head's 

        still spinning. So much of what we are setting aside is just a trade off 

        against destruction.&quot; That doesn't sound much better to me. To make 

        matters worse, Cindy Burrascano of the California Native Plant Society 

        says &quot;We can't get things listed now because of the MSCP. We find 

        something threatened, on or off preserve sites, and Fish and Wildlife 

        tells us that the MSCP means that &quot;adequate protection&quot; has 

        already been established. So they won't list.&quot; The ability to sue 

        is clouded and the sensitive species protection plan is being used to 

        prevent protection. Thanks, Hewlett! Thanks, Irvine!</p>
