      <p> </p>

      <p>I. INTRODUCTION</p>

      <p>Plaintiff RURAL HERITAGE AND WATERSHED INITIATIVE COMMITTEE (ARHWIC@) 

        respectfully submits this rebuttal trial brief according to the briefing 

        schedule and stipulation of the parties.</p>

      <p>The landscape of this action has changed dramatically since the trial 

        briefing began. No longer are there 43 documents at issue. During the 

        briefing, the County has turned over the handwritten notes that were the 

        subject of the summary adjudication motion and also 38 additional documents, 

        albeit in redacted form. This rebuttal pleading will focus on the remaining 

        four non-disclosed documents, which consist of four memos to the Board 

        of Supervisors (including handwritten notes by Supervisor Horn on one 

        of them).</p>

      <p>To justify nondisclosure of these last four documents, the County's reply 

        brief makes three basic points. First, the County disparages the evidence 

        submitted by Plaintiff, stating that it does not add Aany weight to the 

        disclosure side of the balance@ of competing interests. County Reply Brief 

        (CRB at 4). The County pokes fun at the Afive easy pieces@ of evidence 

        submitted by Plaintiff, proclaiming that the evidence Ahardly creates 

        a compelling case for a County conspiracy@ (CRB at 2), and that the documents 

        Alend no credence at all to the allegation of illegal campaigning@ (CRB 

        at 3). The County's analysis of the evidence is flawed and unreasonable. 

      </p>

      <p>The standard is not whether, taking all evidence separately and in the 

        light most favorable to the County, a Acompelling case of conspiracy@ 

        is proven; rather, the question is whether the totality of the evidence, 

        reasonably interpreted, raises a well-founded suspicion of governmental 

        misfeasance that can and should be resolved through disclosure. </p>

      <p>Here, a member of the press witnessed a public meeting of the Board of 

        Supervisors and came to the conclusion that the whole process was rigged. 

        His conclusion is buttressed by several documents, the most important 

        of which are handwritten notes expressing extreme concern about Mr. Gogek's 

        information being Aleaked@ by Asomeone on the McFetridge team@ who knew 

        about the Apre-meeting@ when staff members were told to put a stronger 

        negative message before the Board of Supervisors. Given these facts, the 

        urgency legislation proposed by the Board, aimed right at the Initiative 

        with the specific intent to defeat it, is not innocuous. Nor is the e-mail 

        message written by Supervisor Horn's staff member, Ivan Holler. This e-mail 

        is certainly not, as the County claims, Ainconsistent@ with a plan to 

        keep the Initiative off the ballot; to the contrary, a fair reading of 

        that memorandum shows that Board staff was considering ways to keep the 

        ballot measure from ever reaching the voters. </p>

      <p>In short, plaintiff's evidence more than raises a reasonable suspicion 

        of misfeasance and easily defeats the County's ability to show that the 

        need for secrecy Aclearly outweighs@ the public interest in disclosure.</p>

      <p>Second, the County is trying to impose on plaintiff an evidentiary standard 

        that does not exist. There is no requirement under the CPRA, or anywhere 

        else, that Plaintiff establish a Acompelling case for a County conspiracy@ 

        or a Aprima facie@ case of illegal electioneering. The generic public 

        interest in disclosure is contained in the CPRA itself. That generic interest 

        in disclosure is magnified by the existence of a significant public controversy 

        (reflected in Mr. Gogek's article) over how the County handled the Initiative. 

        It is also strengthened by circumstantial evidence already in Plaintiff's 

        possession. Under the cases, that is more than enough to carry the day. 

        See, e.g., Connell v. Superior Court (56 Cal.App.4th 601, 617 (1997); 

        Citizens for a Better Environment v. Department of Food &amp; Agriculture, 

        171 Cal.App.3d 704, 715 (1985).</p>

      <p>Third, the County claims that the Court must uphold the privilege to 

        protect candid discussion of issues by decision makers (CRB, at 13). The 

        County supposedly fears the possibility of future timidity by government 

        employees, but this fear is unfounded. The request before the Court does 

        not seek the wholesale disclosure of all communications between Board 

        members and their staff. Rather, it seeks four discrete documents based 

        on a reasonable suspicion of governmental misconduct. The County's fear 

        is unfounded. See Braun v. City of Taft, 154 Cal.App.3d 332, 346 (1984) 

        (AJust because disclosure is allowed in this case does not mean that disclosure 

        will be allowed in others. Each case must undergo an individual weighing 

        process. The weighing process involves what public interest is served 

        in this particular instance in not disclosing the information versus the 

        public interest served in disclosing the information.@) When an issue 

        as important as a citizen's initiative measure is at stake, there should 

        be no secrets in government. Disclosure here will either lend further 

        credence to Plaintiff's evidence of governmental impropriety or dispel 

        it. Either way, this will have significant effects on the public's trust 

        in government, which is what the Public Records Act is all about.</p>

      <p>II. ARGUMENT</p>

      <p>A. The County Has Failed to Carry its Burden of Proof Under the CPRA</p>

      <p>The County's Reply Trial Brief completely omits any reference to the 

        burden of proof, suggesting only that the Court Amust balance the public 

        interest in non-disclosure against the public interest in disclosure@ 

        (CRB at 1). This statement plainly ignores that it is the County's burden 

        to prove entitlement to the privilege by demonstrating that Athe public 

        interest in non-disclosure clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure.@ 

        Government Code '6255; California First Amendment Coalition v. Superior 

        Court, 67 Cal.App.4th 159, 172-173 (1998). The balancing under the CPRA 

        is deliberately weighted heavily in favor of disclosure and the County 

        certainly has not overcome its burden. </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>B. Plaintiff's Evidence Supports a Strong Public Interest in Disclosure.</p>

      <p>The County's Reply Brief tries to down-play each individual item of evidence 

        while ignoring the picture painted when all the evidence is considered 

        together. The declarations from County staff amount to testimony of: ADespite 

        what might be inferred from the document, the County didn't do anything 

        wrong.@ It is neither reasonable nor fair to look at the evidence in the 

        light most favorable to the County; the County has always gone to great 

        lengths to publicly proclaim its impartiality. However, the Plaintiff's 

        bias evidence must be assessed by the reasonable person standard.</p>

      <p>As set forth in Plaintiff's Trial Brief, improper electioneering will 

        often be determined by such factors as Astyle, tenor and timing@ of information 

        disseminated about an Initiative. Here, Plaintiff's evidence, viewed reasonably 

        and in totality, clearly raises an inference of misfeasance that warrants 

        disclosure of the four documents in question. </p>

      <p>1. Jim Gogek's Article</p>

      <p>The fact that a member of the news-reporting media perceived impropriety 

        at the presentation of the Initiative to the Board of Supervisors Aadds 

        weight to the disclosure side of the balance@. While the County dismisses 

        the article as nothing more than an unsubstantiated opinion piece, it 

        is not every day that an editorial piece of the San Diego Union accuses 

        the County of misconduct. Indeed, the County concedes that these allegations 

        are serious. (CRB at 2,3.) In the context of the CPRA, an opinion/editorial 

        alleging governmental misconduct should hold special weight. </p>

      <p>Mr. Gogek's article specifically mentions a dress rehearsal of the RHWI 

        report presentation to the Board after which County Chief Administrative 

        Officer, Larry Prior III (LPIII) allegedly told staff he wanted a stronger 

        negative message before it went to the Board. That such a meeting occurred 

        is corroborated by additional evidence now before the Court.</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>2. The Unidentified Handwritten Notes</p>

      <p>The handwritten notes by a staff member in the Chief Administrator's 

        Office on a photocopy of Mr. Gogek's article corroborate the fact that 

        something untoward occurred at the pre-meeting. We now know the exact 

        statements to be as follows:</p>

      <p>Larry's Comments@</p>

      <p>* LPIII believes it was leaked by staff</p>

      <p>* We have a problem! Info re: meeting not accurate</p>

      <p>* We have someone on the McFetridge team</p>

      <p>* How would Gogek have known about the pre-meeting</p>

      <p>* Does Gary have any idea@</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>See Group 3, Document 1 of the Lodged Under Seal Documents (emphasis 

        added). </p>

      <p>The County interprets these notes as reflecting concern Athat there was 

        someone within the office who was relaying to the public the deliberative 

        processes that comprised the steps in the formulation of the report and 

        the polishing of the presentation of the report to the Board . . . A CRB 

        at 7. Perhaps that is a possible interpretation of these notes but it 

        is certainly not the most reasonable or unbiased one. More probably these 

        notes reflect consternation by the County CAO that Asomeone on the McFetridge 

        team@ (i.e., a County planner) who attended the Adress rehearsal@ (i.e., 

        pre-meeting) leaked it to Mr. Gogek that the County planners were told 

        to emphasize the negative aspects of the Initiative in their report to 

        the Board. The County indeed had Aa problem@; its little scheme had been 

        uncovered.</p>

      <p>3. Ivan Holler's e-mail</p>

      <p>The County's analysis of the email by Board of Supervisor staff Ivan 

        Holler also misses the point. Again, it looks at that document in the 

        light most favorable to the County, not as a reasonable person would.</p>

      <p>Before the Initiative could be placed on the November 1998 ballot, a 

        number of time-sensitive hurdles needed to be overcome by Plaintiff. RHWIC 

        needed to submit the initiative to the County, to gather over one-hundred 

        thousand signatures, to have the registrar certify the signatures, and 

        then to calendar the issue on the Board of Supervisor's docket by a certain 

        date for the administrative action of designating the Initiative a Aproposition@ 

        and placing it on the ballot. </p>

      <p>In light of these facts, Mr. Holler's email is considerably more revealing. 

        The time line proposed contained a recommendation for a AFiscal Impact 

        Study prior to placing the initiative on the ballot,@ and thereby sufficient 

        delay to preclude a vote in the general election. The County is sorely 

        wrong when it points to the conservative calculation of deadlines as somehow 

        supporting the legitimacy of the email. They do not. The apparent glee 

        with which Mr. Holler concludes that the RHWI will not make it on the 

        ballot and that Duncan (McFetridge) would have to pay for a special election 

        reflects the underlying perception and treatment of the Initiative throughout 

        the process. Taken together with the other evidence, this email supports 

        plaintiff's allegations of impropriety.</p>

      <p>4. Recently disclosed documents</p>

      <p>After Plaintiff submitted its trial brief, the County disclosed the vast 

        majority of documents previously withheld with allegedly irrelevant portions 

        redacted. Because the redacted portions are often interspersed with fragments 

        of information regarding the RHWI, Plaintiff respectfully requests the 

        Court take great care to ensure all relevant information has been produced. 

        In particular, plaintiff is concerned with instances such as Document 

        20 of Group 2 (dated 3/10/98), where large blocks of RHWI information 

        contain short redacted portions.</p>

      <p>The newly acquired documents lend support to Plaintiff's case and raise 

        additional questions. For example, as noted above, they support the fact 

        that a dress rehearsal of the presentation to the supervisors did, in 

        fact, take place. They also show that Planning Department staff was directed 

        by Gary Pryor to solicit important land-value information from the Building 

        Industry Association, a group vocally opposed to the RHWI. Document 22 

        in Group 2. (Dated 4/6/98). Further, there is reference to a &gt;Murder 

        Squad@ convened in anticipation of significant opposition to the presentation 

        of the report. Document 30 in Group 2. (Dated 5/5/98). These documents 

        suggest that the County came at the Initiative with a bias against it.3 

      </p>

      <p>C. The County's Reply Trial Brief Ignores the Applicable Law Regarding 

        Balancing of Interests</p>

      <p>The County's Reply Trial Brief is devoid of any law, using the excuse 

        that Athere is little if any Alegal@ debate over the requirement for balancing 

        the competing interests@. (CRB at 14). In fact, there is a substantial 

        body of precedent that upholds disclosure of purportedly privileged documents 

        in circumstances similar to those before this Court.</p>

      <p>Distilled to its essence, the County' position is that Plaintiff must 

        prove a Acompelling case for a County conspiracy@ before the documents 

        are disclosed. (CRB at 2) This is obviously not the standard. Rather, 

        there are two compelling interests in disclosure; one is the generic interest 

        under the CPRA for government activities to be conducted under the light 

        of full public scrutiny. See Plaintiff' Trial Brief at 6-7. The other 

        is a case-specific interest in disclosure. </p>

      <p>As to the latter inquiry, there is a plethora of cases supporting disclosure 

        under circumstances such as are present here. See Connell v. Superior 

        Court (1997) 56 Cal.App. 4th 601, 617; Citizens for a Better Environment 

        v. Dep=t. of Food &amp; Agriculture (1985) 171 Cal.App. 3d 704, 715 (disclosure 

        supported when documents concern Athe conduct of county officials in enforcing 

        pesticide use laws and the conduct of state officials in the investigation 

        and supervision of that task...@); CBS, Inc. v. Block (1986) 42 Cal.3d 

        646, 656 (noting strong public interest in document disclosure to Aascertain 

        whether the law is being properly applied or carried out in an evenhanded 

        manner@); Division of Industrial Safety v. Superior Court (1975) 43 Cal.App.3d 

        778, 786 (disclosure supported when it could highlight illegal activities 

        and result in heightened accountability by government agency); Register 

        of Freedom Newspapers, Inc. v. County of Orange (1984) 158 Cal.App.3d 

        893, 909 (disclosure ordered in part due to public interest in finding 

        out how decisions to spend public funds are formulated); In re Franklin 

        National Bank Securities Litigation (1979) 478 F.Supp. 577, 587 (Public 

        interest in disclosure strong when government malfeasance is at issue 

        and documents will assist in Aevaluation@ of extent of culpability).</p>

      <p>D. The County' Assessment of the Withheld Documents Should be Viewed 

        with Skepticism; In Any Event, Disclosure is Warranted to Clear the Air</p>

      <p>Given that plaintiff' knowledge of the documents yet undisclosed is 

        based solely on their description in Defendant' privilege log and Reply 

        Trial Brief, it is difficult to make arguments regarding their particular 

        probative value. The Court will, necessarily, make this relevancy determination. 

        Plaintiffs have three points to make regarding the Court' in camera review.</p>

      <p>First, it is particularly difficult to counteract the County' spin on 

        what a document signifies when Plaintiff is unable to review it. Nevertheless, 

        the Court should keep in mind that there is more than one way to view 

        a document, even a critically important one. For example, the County sees 

        nothing untoward in the handwritten notes appearing on Mr. Gogek' article 

        from the CAO office. On the other hand, a reasonable person, Plaintiff 

        submits, would come to a quite different conclusion about these notes. 

        The same can be said of Mr. Holler' e-mail regarding the possibility 

        of s a special election being funded by Plaintiff' chairman, Duncan McFetridge. 

        Plaintiff respectfully requests the Court to be extremely mindful that 

        the County' perception is not necessarily a reasonable or correct one.4</p>

      <p>Second, the descriptions that have been provided of the documents do 

        lend some support to the need for disclosure. For example, the first withheld 

        document (Group 1, Document 1) allegedly contains information with respect 

        to the need for a complete analysis of the Initiative. This document may 

        prove important when compared to the eventual substance of the report. 

        Given the date of the document, it may also provide a reference point 

        for subsequent actions by the Supervisors. </p>

      <p>The second withheld document (Group 1, Document 2) allegedly contains 

        speaking points with respect to the proposed disenfranchisement legislation. 

        Evidence has been offered that the proposal for legislation was triggered 

        by the RHWI. Any notes or documents which may help to clarify this assertion 

        must be considered probative.</p>

      <p>The third document (Group 1, Document 3) allegedly contains direction 

        to the CAO regarding dissemination of the County' RHWI report. Importantly, 

        the CAO is directly implicated in the allegations of bias put forth in 

        Jim Gogek' newspaper article. Further, any indication of which specific 

        portion of the public the CAO was directed to forward the report may indicate 

        the supervisor' desire to put certain members of the public, such as 

        the farm bureau or the Building Industry Association, at an advantage 

        by receiving the report earlier. </p>

      <p>The County' description of the fourth document (Group 1, Document 4) 

        also points to a need for disclosure. If there was bias expressed by any 

        of the Supervisors, and Plaintiff has specifically referred to negative 

        statements by Supervisor Horn reported in a newspaper article, then any 

        additional indication of bias would be important and probative.</p>

      <p>Third, whatever the four withheld documents show on their face, there 

        is a public controversy here that requires resolution. If, indeed, the 

        withheld documents show that the County was doing nothing wrong, then 

        the County should not be afraid of disclosing them. See Connell v. Superior 

        Court (1997) 56 Cal.App. 4th 601, 617 (disclosure justified because Athe 

        public interest demands the ability to verify. Only in this way can the 

        public be certain, for example, that there is not a conspiracy of silence 

        . . .)(emphasis added) On the other hand, if improprieties are evident, 

        then the documents are obviously probative and should be disclosed.</p>

      <p>CONCLUSION <br>

        This Court should order disclosure of the four remaining documents, after 

        examining them in camera, because the public interest in governmental 

        secrecy does not Aclearly outweigh@ the public interest in disclosure. 

        Plaintiff will shortly subpoena witnesses in the event further evidence 

        is deemed appropriate.</p>
