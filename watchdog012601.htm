        <blockquote>The Board of Supervisors, bowing to special interests who cried foul 

          over the draft GP 2020 plan, voted to scrap the draft General Plan revision 

          that represents 2 years of work, the input of the twenty-six affected 

          communities, and over one million dollars.The Board directed DPLU to 

          draft a new revision that will be guided by the input of a committee 

          heavily stacked with development and special interests including the 

          Farm Bureau.</blockquote>

        <font size="2"><strong><u>Draft Grading Ordinance Removes Agricultural Exemptio</u></strong></font> 

        <blockquote>The County of San Diego is in the process of adopting a new grading 

          ordinance that will remove the agricultural exemption that currently 

          exists regarding grading permits for agricultural land.This agricultural 

          exemption has been used by numerous developers as a thinly veiled excuse 

          to destroy precious backcountry sensitive habitats as a prelude to later 

          filing a map for subdivision of agricultural land.The new grading ordinance 

          will go before the Board of Supervisors on 7 February 2001.The County 

          argued in Superior Court during the hearing regarding GPA 96-03 that 

          requiring these agricultural lands to be subject to a grading ordinance 

          would be onerous and too costly to farmers. The court found the County’s 

          excuses inadequate. Now, in a scant few weeks time, the County has drafted 

          just such an ordinance. This grading ordinance revision coincidentally 

          precedes the County’s approaching appeal of GPA 96-03. Interesting to 

          note that the Farm Bureau is not fighting this new grading ordinance 

          that would apply to agricultural lands. At the same time, interesting 

          that they have been allotted a slot on the new steering committee for 

          GP 2020. Yet another example of the special relationship the Farm Bureau 

          has with the County.</blockquote>

        <font size="2"><strong><u>LOSS OF VALLEY CENTER CITRUS GROVE (TM 5173)</u></strong></font> 

        <blockquote>435 acres of prime citrus grove and native habitat in Valley Center 

          are proposed for subdividing into 169 lots. No mitigation is offered 

          for the loss of this productive agricultural operation since the developer 

          argues that the two-acre house sites will retain many of the citrus 

          trees. </blockquote>

        <u><font size="2"><strong>Last But Not Least…</strong></font></u> 

        <blockquote>Happy Chinese New Year! We begin the Year of the Snake; snakes are 

          revered by the Chinese as symbols of wisdom. May the next year be one 

          of wise action!</blockquote>
