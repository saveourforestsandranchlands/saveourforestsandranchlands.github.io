    <TD> <p>Sprawl consists of commercial and residential development in areas 

        not contiguous with existing urban areas. Sprawl causes a variety of harmful 

        effects. </p>

      <blockquote><img height="20" hspace="11" src="images/leabul1e.gif" width="20">Loss of valuable agricultural lands. <br>

        <br>

        <img height="20" hspace="11" src="images/leabul1e.gif" width="20">Conversion of agricultural and rural lands to uses inconsistent with their 

        current designation drives out traditional land uses. Rising tax assessments 

        force farmers and ranchers to give up their lands even if they would prefer 

        to continue using them for traditional uses. <br>

        <br>

        <img height="20" hspace="11" src="images/leabul1e.gif" width="20">Loss of crucial wildlife habitats. Commercial and residential uses cause 

        blockage and fragmentation of crucial habitats and corridors for our endangered 

        wildlife. *See images of road encroachment <br>

        <br>

        <img height="20" hspace="11" src="images/leabul1e.gif" width="20">The EPA has identified urban runoff as the principal source of contamination 

        to inland and coastal waters in most urban areas. Paving over ever more 

        watersheds will exacerbate the problem by adding new sources of pollution, 

        and removing natural filtration mechanisms. Already, we suffer beach closures 

        due to contamination everytime it rains. <br>

        <br>

        <img height="20" hspace="11" src="images/leabul1e.gif" width="20">Sprawling development causes increased automotive traffic and air pollution.

        <br>

        <img height="20" hspace="11" src="images/leabul1e.gif" width="20">Sprawling development drains public infrastructure resources from our 

        urban centers, harming services in our cities. <br>

        <br>

        <img height="20" hspace="11" src="images/leabul1e.gif" width="20">Residents of far-flung bedroom communities commute to the urban centers 

        and use these services, but don't pay for them. </p>

        <img height="20" hspace="11" src="images/leabul1e.gif" width="20">Sprawl doesn't provide affordable housing. Our region is projected to 

        grow by several million inhabitants in the next thirty years. Projections 

        by the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) indicate that even 

        under conditions of total buildout in our rural areas, these lands would 

        not support more than 100,000 additional people, due to current subdivision 

        sizes in these outlying areas and the expense of building there. Such 

        sprawl would lead only to very expensive housing for the privileged few, 

        while all of us would suffer the ill effects described.

      </blockquote>

      <p> We are still far from exhausting space for commercial and residential 

        developments in areas already designated for such uses. We don't need 

        to sacrifice our valuable rural resources. </p>
