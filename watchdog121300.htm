      <blockquote>SOFAR’s position on GP 2020 continues to gain support. Already, 
        Center for Biological Diversity, San Diego Audubon, Palomar Audubon, Mountain 
        Defense League, Back Country Coalition, and Friends of Los Penisquitos 
        Canyon Preserve have endorsed our position. The issue goes to the Board 
        of Supervisors on 10 January 2001. We invite you to join us at the hearing.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>To summarize, the basic problem of the draft 2020 Plan is that 
        it is population-based rather than resource-based. Values such as wildlands 
        and watershed have regional significance yet are left undesignated in 
        the draft plan. The draft 2020 Plan does not contain any Regional Resource 
        Categories such as Urban Limit Line, Country Town Boundaries, and Environmentally 
        Constrained Areas which then naturally form the hierarchy of planning 
        goals.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>These Regional Resource Categories are the critical link between 
        the goals and policies of the General Plan and zoning implementation. 
        They are the standards that guide the placement of zoning. No rational, 
        logical implementation of the General Plan can occur without these essential 
        planning categories.</blockquote>

        PARCEL MAP (TPM 20474)</u></font></strong></p>
      <blockquote>This 85.50 acre parcel, located between Julian and Lake Cuyamaca, 
        contains some of those gorgeous grasslands and oak and pine woodlands 
        for which San Diego County’s backcountry is famous. Under its present 
        use, grazing, it helps support a healthy ecosystem that also includes 
        the wildlands of the Cleveland National Forest. </blockquote>
      <blockquote>This parcel is slated for subdividing into five ranchette parcels 
        ranging in size from 12 to 21 acres. The zoning would allow a minimum 
        parcel size of just 8 acres. These small parcels will fragment the habitat 
        and wound this area of the ecosystem. This is a excellent example of the 
        County’s poor planning for our precious natural resources.</blockquote>
