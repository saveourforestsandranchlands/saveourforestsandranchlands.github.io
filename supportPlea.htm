    <TD> <p>In the long ordeal to save San Diego's backcountry, once again, we 

        are making an urgent appeal to SOFAR's loyal supporters to help us raise 

        funds in order to challenge a Board of Supervisors (BOS) decision impacting 

        200,000 acres of wildlands in San Diego's backeountry. Against all sound 

        advice and reason, the BOS has just passed the County's disastrous proposal 

        for GPA 96-03. </p>

      <p>GPA 96-03 is, as you may recall, the County's response to a Court order 

        to come up with a plan because of legal action brought by SOFAR against 

        the County in 1995. SOFAR argued that the General Plan was missing an 

        agricultural element and the plan encouraged development in the backcountry 

        due to urban zoning on rangeland preserves and open spaces. The Court 

        agreed and ordered the County to amend its General Plan. </p>

      <p>During the County's first attempt, SOFAR discovered that Pardee Construction's 

        chief counsel, in league with the farm bureau, were advising the county 

        on how to zone backcountry rangelands for development. Needless to say, 

        they could muster no credible evidence for such a charade and they were 

        thrown out of court. </p>

      <p>Now comes the County's second attempt to comply with the court order 

        and it is much worse. Hidden in a mountain of legalese, under the name 

        of intensive agriculture, is a proposal to radically change land use throughout 

        the backcountry. It is a deeply flawed plan that must be challenged. For 

        example: </p>

      <p>GPA 96-03 allows lot-sizes that will encourage sprawl development on 

        existing rangeland and watershed lands. </p>

      <p>GPA 96-03 fails to provide any mitigation for the devastating impacts 

        it will cause-- in virtually every CEQA category. </p>

      <p>GPA 96-03 is based on a flawed environmental review that failed to investigate, 

        as required by law, alternatives to mitigate impacts of the amendment. 

      </p>

      <p>GPA 96-03 eliminates further environmental review for complete clearing 

        and grading of the natural vegetation of the land. </p>

      <p>GPA 96-03 will destroy the ranchland and wildland in the north and east 

        portions of San Diego. </p>

      <p>Since this matter is already under Court jurisdiction, it must return 

        to the Court for final approval. We must act to challenge the County's 

        proposal that if implemented will change the character of our backeountry 

        forever. </p>

      <p>Our attorneys consider this to be a case of the utmost legal and environmental 

        importance -- a case that they can and must win. The good news is that 

        Shute, Mihaly, &amp; Weinberger, the premier environmental attorneys from 

        San Francisco, have agreed to join with Steve Crandall and Marco Gonzalez 

        in arguing this matter, and will represent SOFAR at significantly reduced 

        rates due to the public interest nature of this case. We are honored to 

        have such a prestigious team of attorney's defending our cause. But, we 

        must quickly raise funds to make this happen. </p>

      <p>Thank you for your past support and hope you can help in this moment 

        of need. </p>

      <p>Sincerely, </p>

      <p>Duncan McFetridge <br>
