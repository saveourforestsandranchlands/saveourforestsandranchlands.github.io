    <TD> <p>GPA 96-03, the County&#8217;s preferred alternative, and its alternatives 

        are based on minimum lot sizes for Williamson Act agricultural preserves 

        derived from Dr. William Wood&#8217;s study. The project proposes 10-acre 

        minimum lot sizes west of the County Water Authority (CWA) line. Lands 

        east of the CWA line would have a 40-acre minimum lot size or a 10-acre 

        minimum lot size if it can be demonstrated that there is evidence of adequate 

        soils, topography, and water availability to support the proposed agriculture. 

        <br>

        Dr. Wood&#8217;s study concludes that a 10-acre minimum in an agricultural 

        preserve is adequate to protect long-term agricultural use. This was based 

        on false assumptions and, therefore, comes to a wrong conclusion.</p>

      <p>First, he argues that the majority of &#8220;farmers&#8221; have another 

        job or source of income. He completely ignores the level of income as 

        a factor in viable agriculture. This sets up the inclusion of &#8220;hobby&#8221; 

        farms for the average size farm acreage in San Diego.</p>

      <p>Second, the argument of the impossibility for a small farm to show a 

        profit tends to be a self-fulfilling prophecy &#8211; small lots tend 

        to have a high price per acre. In contrast, larger size parcels will tend 

        to have a lower cost per acre, and the farmer will find the cost of the 

        land easier to afford.</p>

      <p>Third, and especially absurd, is the excuse that ranching will continue 

        as long as one can eat away at its assets &#8211; the land. This logic 

        only means that ranching is a holding pattern for future development.</p>

      <p>Fourth, the argument that 10 acres is a good size because it attracts 

        more &#8220;rural&#8221; people has nothing to do with agriculture. All 

        this means is that 10 acres is a good rural residential lot size.</p>

      <p>Fifth, the larger size parcels being detrimental to agriculture as they 

        provide an attraction for large-scale subdivisions is flawed logic. Under 

        this logic, the backcountry carved into 10-acre parcels would be ideal. 

        These parcel sizes would not attract large-scale developers but would 

        only be suitable for ranchettes not viable agriculture.</p>

      <p>Finally, the 10-acre minimum lot size for lands west of the CWA and 40-acre 

        minimum east of the line do not meet the requirements of the Williamson 

        Act for agricultural preserve lands.<br>
