      <blockquote>Good news – The Attorney General for the State 

        of California has decided to wade into the battle regarding GPA 96-03, 

        the General Plan Amendment that will determine the fate of San Diego’s 

        backcountry, and has filed an amicus brief in support of SOFAR’s position 

        on GPA 96-03. This is in addition to the amicus brief filed by nine conservation 

        groups – the Sierra Club, San Diego Audubon, California Native Plant Society, 

        Center for Biological Diversity, Surfrider Foundation, San Diego BayKeeper, 

        California Oak Foundation, Environmental Health Coalition, and Mountain 

        Defense League – supporting SOFAR’s position.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>As was reported previously, SOFAR is challenging 

        in court the County’s action in certifying the Environmental Impact Report 

        (EIR) for GPA 96-03. The EIR assumes that the entire 191,000 acres of 

        Ag 20 rangeland and wild lands will be completely cleared. The EIR is 

        woefully inadequate in its analysis of the severe adverse impacts on biological 

        resources, water resources, and water quality that would result from this 

        environmental catastrophe. The EIR also fails to offer adequate mitigation 

        for these impacts and fails to adequately analyze the cumulative impacts 

        on these resources. SOFAR’s position is the County violated the California 

        Environmental Quality Act in certifying the EIR and is asking the court 

        to set aside this certification. </blockquote></TD>
