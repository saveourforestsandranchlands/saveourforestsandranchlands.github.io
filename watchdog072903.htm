    <TD><p>In order to get the Rural Lands Initiative on the March 2004 ballot 

        the initiative committee must collect the signatures of 72,000 registered 

        voters. Our volunteers have done a great job so far collecting signatures 

        at stores and events and from friends, family and colleagues. We still 

        have many signatures to get and a short period of time in which to do 

        so. That is why we are asking for your support and help. </p>

      <p>If you are willing to circulate a petitions, please call us (619-702-5470) 

        and we will get them out to you that day. If you want to volunteer to 

        collect signatures during the last few weeks of the campaign, please contact 

        us, as we need a large surge at the end! </p>

      <p>Finally, I wanted to thank you for making this petition drive possible. 

        San Diego needs its citizens to take action and protect the back country 

        from urban sprawl and to protect our water from the pollution and waste 

        associated with that sprawl. </p>

      <p> Thanks, </p>
