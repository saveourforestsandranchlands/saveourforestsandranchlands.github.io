      <p><strong><u>GPA 96-03 HEARING!</u></strong></p>

      <blockquote>We need your support! GPA 96-03 (now known as GPA 01-01) is scheduled 

        for a public hearing at the Department of Planning and Land Use on Friday, 

        March 8, 2002. The hearing begins at 9:00am, 96-03 is agenda item #4. 

        We need SOFAR supporters to speak out at this hearing! The most important 

        comments that you can make on this critical backcountry issue are: 1) 

        this General Plan Amendment allows for a great likelihood of subdividing 

        our backcountry for residential use (which we are strongly opposed to) 

        and 2) the Environmental Impact Report for 96-03 is inadequate in measuring 

        residential impacts upon the priceless natural resources that reside in 

        our backcountry. We have expert testimony on the record that clearly states 

        this project is a &quot;ranchette&quot;/sprawl development plan that has 

        not been properly analyzed by the county.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>Please call (619-230-1963) or email (sofar@nethere.net) our office this 

        week for more information regarding this critical backcountry issue. And/or 

        please refer to SOFAR's website (www.sofar.org) for an extensive history 

        of General Plan Amendment 96-03. </blockquote>

      <blockquote>Hearing Location: DPLU Hearing Room, 5201 Ruffin Road, Suite B, San Diego.</blockquote>
