      </p>

        

      <blockquote> The hearing before the Planning Commission for General Plan 

        Amendment 96-03 has been changed from July 23rd to September 17th, 1999. 

        Please mark your calendar for this important hearing. </blockquote>

      <blockquote>GPA 96-03 is the County's answer to SOFAR's successful lawsuit 

        over the County's deficient plans for our Agricultural Preserve, Land 

        Use Designator 20, farmlands. The County of San Diego is bound by the 

        findings of the San Diego Superior Court that the Land Use, Conservation, 

        and Open Space Elements of the County's General Plan are inadequate <i>(SOFAR 

        vs. County of San Diego, 1996). </i>On January 11, 1996, A Superior Court 

        in San Diego County issued a judgment finding that the Lan d Use, Conservation, 

        and Open Space Elements of the County's General Plan were inadequate because 

        it defers consideration of some issues to an Agricultural Element which 

        does not exist. Therefore, it could not be relied upon in making an informed 

        dec ision on a project. The Court mandated that no decision on similar 

        projects be made until the defective General Plan elements were made adequate.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>In 1979, the Board of Supervisors adopted the Land Use Element 

        of the General Plan a regional blueprint that lays the foundation integrating 

        public facilities and transportation with industrial, commercial, residential, 

        and agricultural land use for the entire County. Minimum lot size criteria 

        for agriculture was deferred to the Agriculture Element. Tragically, the 

        Agriculture Element was never adopted. Instead, one-sixth of the landmass 

        of San Diego County, comprising its most valuable agricult ural resources, 

        has been left with contradictory General Plan guidance.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>Under the terms of GPA 96-03, the County attempts to establish 

        minimum lot size criteria: arbitrarily and without proper study, a 10-acre 

        lot size minimum for those Ag 20 lands west of the County Water Authority 

        (CWA) line, and a 40-acre lot size minim um for those Ag 20 lands east 

        of the CWA line. Most of the lands east of the CWA line are cattle ranches 

        without infrastructure to serve intensive farming. This is dryland farming. 

        The County's proposal is contrary to the County's own policy (Po licy 

        I-38) and Williamson Act guidelines that require 80-acre minimums for 

        grazing land. Likewise, west of the CWA line, according to those same 

        guidelines and County policy, depending upon the different crops and conditions, 

        those lands also require, in many cases, larger lot size minimums. SOFAR 

        has drafted a proposal that will both meet the Williamson Act guidelines 

        and Policy I-38 requirements. </blockquote>

      <blockquote>Unfortunately, not only is GPA 96-03 an inadequate plan for 

        Ag 20 farmlands, which constitute 191,000 acres, it completely ignores 

        the rest of the agricultural lands in the County. Land Use Designator 

        19, Intensive Agriculture, farmlands, which constit ute 27,600 acres, 

        are barely touched upon in this document. Entirely ignored are the hundreds 

        of thousands of acres of additional agricultural lands.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>The loss of agricultural land in San Diego County has reached 

        devastating proportions. In the years 1984 to 1996, our county lost over 

        31,000 acres of farmland. Of this farmland, we lost 4,370 acres of prime 

        farmland, over 28% of the total. We lost 14, 629 acres of farmland of 

        statewide importance, over 50% of the total. We also had over 12,000 acres 

        of farmland committed to non-agricultural use.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>

	  	Agriculture is San Diego County's fourth largest industry. Farming 

        grossed over $ 1.18 billion last year. We cannot continue to withstand 

        the loss of farmland of the present magnitude without severe consequences.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>

      	SOFAR urges the County to give no further consideration to GPA 96-03 until 

      	it adequately addresses <u>ALL</u> of the Country's agricultural lands. 

      	We will be at the hearing on September 17th to make our voices heard. </blockquote>
