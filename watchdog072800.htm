      <blockquote>The 

        Board of Supervisors on 26 July 2000 followed the CAO’s of the Department 

        of Planning &amp; Land Use recommendation to direct the project applicant 

        to revise the Jacumba Valley Ranch project, recirculate the EIR, and come 

        back to the Board in about 8 months time. None of the recommended revisions 

        to the project, such as adding medical facilities to the congregate care 

        facility and expanding the equestrian facility, change the substance of 

        a massive, misplaced, inappropriate project proposed for prime farmland 

        in a remote area of East County.</blockquote>

      <P><FONT size=2><STRONG><U>HILL RANCH &amp; THE GROVE</U></STRONG></font></P>

      <blockquote>Two proposed projects in Bonsall, Hill Ranch and The Grove, are being reviewed 

        for time extensions for their tentative maps. Hill Ranch would subdivide 145 acres 

        of productive citrus orchard into 38 dwelling units. The Grove would subdivide 293 acres 

        of native hillside, sloping down towards the San Luis Rey River, into 

        85 dwelling units. Both projects 

        are prime examples of ill-planned projects for San Diego County’s agricultural 

        and open space lands that are allowed to occur because our county lacks 

        the protections that would be afforded by an Agricultural Element for 

        our General Plan.</blockquote>

      <P><font size=2><STRONG><U>RAMONA PROJECTS</U></STRONG></font></P>

      <blockquote>Ramona is in a crisis caused by developers proposing to develop much of the remaining 

        grasslands and grazing lands of Ramona. Most of these projects are located 

        in Specific Planning Areas (SPAs). These SPAs would allow intensive, urban-style developments to occur 

        in outlying areas far from existing services necessary for development. Proponents of these projects are anxious to receive vesting rights 

        before GP 2020, the update of San Diego County’s General Plan, is adopted. GP 2020 would remove the SPA designation 

        and require much larger lot size minimums, up to 160-acres, for any projects. Proposed projects in Ramona include:</blockquote>

		<p><STRONG><U><font size="2">FEATURE ARTICLE BY DOUG BELL</font></U></STRONG></P>

      <blockquote>We would like to introduce SOFAR’s new Vice President Doug Bell by publishing 

        his editorial on a suggested moratorium for land-use projects until GP 

        2020, the County’s draft General Plan update, is adopted.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>&quot;GP 2020, the County’s land use blueprint for the next 

        twenty years, is due to be adopted by the Board of Supervisors soon. For 

        the County this is another defining moment. Having failed once before 

        to draft and implement a responsible (and legal) land use plan and by 

        rejecting (and actually campaigning against) Proposition B, the Board 

        of Supervisors now has a chance to earn the “smart growth” credentials 

        it so publicly advertises by declaring an interim moratorium on all new 

        development until GP 2020 is adopted. </blockquote>

      <blockquote>The reasons why a moratorium 

        is necessary are the hundreds of vested commercial and residential projects 

        already in the planning pipeline that stand to be approved regardless 

        of their non-conformity to the new plan. These projects, which will litter 

        the backcountry with big box retail stores, supermarkets, strip malls, 

        and housing tracts, are to smart growth what glassy-winged sharpshooters 

        are to the local wine industry. </blockquote>

      <blockquote>Their impact on our county’s natural and economic resources 

        would be devastating. Responsible action, starting with a moratorium ordinance 

        the supervisors are legally authorized to impose, is needed now to protect 

        the county’s ability to accommodate recently approved development as it 

        formulates strategies to address the caravan of county-wide problems that 

        take turns in local headlines‹from sewage and pollution control to water 

        and power distribution. With little wiggle room left, the Board of Supervisors 

        might at last decide that the right thing to do is also the legal thing, 

        and vice versa.&quot;</blockquote>
