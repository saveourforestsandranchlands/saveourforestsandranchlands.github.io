        East County Opinion<br>

        GP2020: DOES THE COUNTY REALLY HAVE A PLAN?</strong></p>

      <p>

        Five years ago, the San Diego County Board of Supervisors embarked on 

        a multi-million dollar effort to revise the San Diego County General Plan, 

        the land use &quot;constitution&quot; that sets the zoning pattern for 

        the vast unincorporated areas of the County. The stated purpose of this 

        planning effort, called General Plan 2020 (GP2020), was to be a &quot;comprehensive 

        update&quot; of the County Plan for land development, roads, water supplies 

        and other infrastructure until, as the name would suggest, the year 2020. 

      </p>

      <p>Of course once a plan is established, it must be implemented and there 

        must be a commitment by the County to adhere to it. Otherwise all the 

        dollars and time spent on the plan will be wasted. That is why a recent 

        action by the Board of Supervisors brings into question its dedication 

        to the planning effort. </p>

      <p>Previously the County's General Plan could be changed by a developer 

        only after satisfying threshold criteria set forth in Board of Supervisor 

        Policy I-63. That Policy gave equal standing to a Community Planning Group 

        and the Director of Planning and Land Use and required 6 out of 10 findings 

        to be made before a change to a Community's General Plan could be initiated. 

        Negative determinations, by either the affected Planning Group or the 

        Director, sent the application to a public hearing before the Board of 

        Supervisors for a final decision. So why did the Board of Supervisors 

        rewrite a Policy that has been in effect for almost 30 years and was overwhelmingly 

        supported by Community Planning and Sponsor Groups? </p>

      <p>It is now known that there was a concerted effort by the development 

        community to eliminate Policy I-63. A memo from Stonegate Development, 

        submitted at the April 30th hearing indicates a long-standing effort to 

        eliminate or at least seriously revise the Policy's requirements. A memo 

        from this company, read from at the hearing stated &quot;Success on our 

        part on the Policy I-63, Section III exemption could open the floodgate 

        for projects county-wide.&quot;</p>

      <p>By eliminating the Policy I-63 findings, the Board of Supervisors has 

        more than fulfilled the wishes of the development industry; it has opened 

        the floodgates for speculative development in the County and made a mockery 

        of the very concept of the General Plan.</p>

      <p>So what are the threshold requirements for changing the County's General 

        Plan under the new rewritten Policy?</p>

      <p> &quot;It is policy of the Board of Supervisors that any amendment to 

        the County General Plan must be initiated by the Planning Director, Planning 

        Commission, or Board of Supervisors. All requests must be filed initially 

        with and reviewed by the Planning Director. The request shall be accompanied 

        by the appropriate fees paid<br>

        pursuant to Section 362 of the San Diego County Administrative Code.&quot;</p>

      <p>There are none! There are no findings and no requirement for a county 

        hearing if the elected Planning Group opposes proceeding with a General 

        Plan Amendment (GPA). In fact, it will not be possible for a community 

        planning or sponsor group to appeal a developer's proposed change to their 

        community plan, if it is approved by the Planning Director. On the other 

        hand, if the Planning Director denies a developer's request to process 

        a GPA, he can appeal to the Planning Commission. At the Commission, an 

        approval cannot be appealed. However, a denial of the developer's general 

        plan may be appealed to the Board of Supervisors. Hard to believe, but 

        true! </p>

      <p>Actually, it is not even clear if the County can legally deny a request 

        since there are no findings. So what does this mean for GP 2020? </p>

      <p>Extending the quote form the Stonegate Memorandum, &quot;Success on our 

        part on the Policy I-63, Section III exemption could open the floodgate 

        for projects county-wide. I expect even the Supervisors will try to avoid 

        this.&quot;</p>

      <p>The Development Community succeeded, beyond their wildest dreams. With 

        the general plan amendment threshold process fully politicized, the &quot;floodgates&quot; 

        are open and GP2020 and County General Plan is a farce. </p>

      <p>What can be done?</p>

      <p>When representative government breaks down, the people can become the 

        powers that be, through the Ballot Initiative Process. The time has come.</p>
