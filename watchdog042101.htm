      <p><strong><font size="2"><u>PREDATOR KILLING UPDATES</u></font></strong></p>

        <blockquote>

		Good news: Idaho has dropped its proposal to fund a study involving the 

        killing of bears and cougars because of the public outcry. Oregon also 

        has second thoughts on submitting a funding proposal to US Fish &amp; 

        Wildlife Service for their cougar killing study because of the overwhelming 

        number of public comments against such an outrageous proposal. Third piece 

        of good news: the House Appropriations Committee of Colorado has killed 

        the funding of a study of coyote killing to try to increase the deer population 

        for hunters. All this news holds out hope that finally the West will recognize 

        the role that our top predators play in a natural, balanced ecosystem.

      <p><strong><font size="2"><u>SoCal NATIONAL FOREST MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATES</u></font></strong></p>

        <blockquote>

		The Management Plans for the four SoCal National Forests - Cleveland, 

        Angeles, San Bernardino, and Los Padres - are in the process of being 

        updated as the result of the settlement of a lawsuit filed by our friends 

        at the Center for Biological Diversity. The Forest Service is actively 

        soliciting public comments for these updates. We encourage you to write 

        to the Forest Service asking for additional protections for these last 

        reserves of much of SoCal's biodiversity. Following are suggestions for 

        the Forest Service:</blockquote>

      <blockquote><blockquote>1. Fully provide for survival and recovery of all state and federally 

        listed species and Forest Sensitive species.</p>

      <p>2. Increase new Research Natural Areas (RNAs).</p>

      <p>3. Increase Special Botanical and Zoological Areas.</p>

      <p>4. Protect critical habitat linkages and wildlife corridors.</p>

      <p>5. Recommend to Congress additional Wilderness Areas and manage them 

        for their Wilderness values.</p>

      <p>6. Recommend to Congress Wild and Scenic Rivers and manage them for their 

        Wild and Scenic values.</p>

      <p>7. Protect all remaining roadless areas, including those less than 5,000 

        acres, from road building and other intrusions.</p>

      <p>8. Conserve all rare and declining forest habitats such as montane meadows, 

        oak woodlands, and old-growth forests.</p>

      <p>9. Protect all riparian areas and streamside areas from cattle grazing.</p>

      <p>10. Withdraw from mineral entry areas with special wildlife, vegetative, 

        roadless <br>

        and other sensitive values.</p>

      <p>11. Prioritize low-impact recreation and watershed protection over all 

        other <br>

        permitted forest uses and activities. </p>

      <p>12. Adopt a Fire Management Plan that incorporates a natural fire regime 

        and <br>

        prescribed burns to establish a more natural fire regime. </p>

      <p>13. Eradicate undesirable exotic species.</blockquote></blockquote>
