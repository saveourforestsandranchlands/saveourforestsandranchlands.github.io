    <TD> <p>San Diego County&#8217;s Questionable Commitment to Livable Communities 

        and Smart Growth</p>

      <p>The credibility gap regarding San Diego County&#8217;s commitment to 

        livable communities and &#8220;smart growth&#8221; widened last month 

        when the Board of Supervisors voted to scrap over two years&#8217; work 

        on Alternative 3, a draft proposal by county planners and twenty six community 

        planning groups to establish zoning guidelines for unincorporated areas 

        of the county for the next twenty years. With a wave of the supervisors&#8217; 

        wand, one million tax dollars and thousands of hours of civic input vanished 

        so that an even better plan might take its place. But better for whom?</p>

      <p>Limiting growth in unincorporated parts of the county to preserve &#8220;the 

        rural character of non-urban lands,&#8221; as described in the county&sup1;s 

        current general plan, is a heresy to land rights advocates and self-styled 

        aggrieved property owners who have waited years to cash in on California&#8217;s 

        real estate profit stampede. Yet restricting growth in rural areas of 

        the county so urban problems such as traffic gridlock, water shortages, 

        polluted runoff, habitat destruction and overcrowding--already acute in 

        the City of San Diego--do not destroy San Diego&#8217;s backcountry is 

        the very essence of smart growth.</p>

      <p>The county&#8217;s big mistake, aside from its sweeping rejection of 

        the area planning maps and zoning recommendations submitted by the planning 

        groups, is abandoning the resource-based goals and policies of the current 

        plan and replacing them with population targets to allow high-density 

        development with little or no regard for infrastructure or the region&#8217;s 

        vital natural and economic resources. To accomplish this the supervisors 

        voted to form a 15-member &#8220;interest group&#8221; to come up with 

        new goals and policies based not on resource categories, but on higher 

        population growth estimates.</p>

      <p>Hanging like a cloud over the whole planning process is a Superior Court 

        decision last August rejecting an attempt by the county to rezone 191,000 

        acres of backcountry watershed and wilderness lands. The general plan 

        amendment, 96-03, had already been invalidated in 1996 for its failure 

        to identify environmental impacts in accordance with state law. But last 

        year, recalcitrant county attorneys showed up in court to make the same 

        case for the same plan before the same judge, to no avail. Unlike the 

        City of San Diego, which recently accepted responsibility for a 34-million-gallon 

        sewage spill in June and has agreed to pay a $3.5 million fine and move 

        on, the county has announced it will fight for a plan twice thrown out 

        of court and condemned by the state attorney general&sup1;s office. Not 

        only is the county likely to lose another appeal as it goes judge shopping 

        with a defective product, it&sup1;s wasting time and tax dollars in the 

        process.</p>

      <p>It&#8217;s fair to ask why it takes millions of dollars of county funds 

        and a judge&#8217;s time (another scarce regional resource) to stop the 

        persistent, illegal designs of democratically elected officials. Is it 

        something in the water?</p>

      <p>That's one possibility. In 1999, pollution from sewage spills and urban 

        runoff closed beaches in San Diego County for 141 days and, according 

        to the county, the water at those beaches was &#8220;unsafe&#8221; 68% 

        of the year. A report recently released by the World Resources Institute 

        reveals what residents of San Diego&sup1;s backcountry already know: Ground 

        water levels are dropping and What&#8217;s left is being steadily contaminated 

        by pesticides, pathogens, and a growing variety of urban and industrial 

        pollutants, threatening the sole source of drinking water for thousands 

        of county residents. A clean water conference announced by the supervisors 

        last year never got off the ground for a lack of serious proposals from 

        the county. And the supervisors have been dragging their feet on authorizing 

        mandatory pollution controls for new developments to prevent the further 

        contamination of lakes, rivers, and streams from storm water runoff.</p>

      <p>Until now there&#8217;s been no sign of intelligent life on the subject 

        of the county&#8217;s general plan, either at the county planning department 

        or in local news media. But a recent San Diego Union-Tribune editorial 

        recognized the urgency of restricting growth in the backcountry and warned 

        of the consequences if current growth patterns were allowed to continue. 

        So far, supervisors and county planners don&#8217;t seem to be listening. 

        Their decision to appeal the latest court ruling demonstrates bad faith, 

        and their creation of the new, 15-member &#8220;interest group,&#8221; 

        to the applause of developers and a new group representing backcountry 

        property owners living outside California, makes it clear that in the 

        county's view, continuous sprawl is a viable planning option, and the 

        goals of the old plan which called for &#8220;wise use of the County&#8217;s 

        land resources,&#8221; and &#8220;limiting urban densities in non-urban 

        areas to lands within existing Country Towns&#8221; inhibit the county&sup1;s 

        ability to provide for affordable housing ($500 million ranchettes, luxury 

        apartments and condos) and amenities (big-box chain grocery and department 

        stores and strip malls).</p>

      <p>As they seek vindication in the courts for a general plan amendment that 

        flouts the law and fails the &#8220;smart growth&#8221; litmus test, county 

        supervisors will be hard pressed to convince county residents of their 

        commitment to a new general plan that protects the rural character of 

        the backcountry and uses land resources &#8220;wisely.&#8221; Considering 

        current demands on our region&#8217;s water resources, sewage, energy, 

        and transportation infrastructure, and the endangered status of wildlife, 

        natural habitat, and open space, the county can no longer afford to play 

        politics with our future.</p>

      <p>Dropping the appeal to GPA 96-03 would go a long way to restoring credibility 

        to county government. Restoring faith in the county&sup1;s intentions 

        will require the supervisors to declare a moratorium on all new development 

        in unincorporated areas of the county until a new plan is adopted. A moratorium 

        will insure the integrity of the planning process by preventing projects 

        that would destroy important resources from moving forward while new land-use 

        guidelines are being formulated.</p>

      <p>Only if the county can disentangle itself from special interests can 

        it produce a responsible plan that protects the rural character of the 

        backcountry and supports livable, sustainable communities to create a 

        county worthy of our affection.<br>
