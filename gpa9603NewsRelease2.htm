    <TD> <p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 6/16/00:</p>

      <p>In a case that is gaining statewide and national attention, the San Diego 

        Superior Court today permitted the filing of two amicus briefs in support 

        of Save Our Forest &amp; Ranchlands' (SOFAR) lawsuit against San Diego 

        County's proposal (GPA 96-03) to replan and rezone approximately 200,000 

        acres of backcountry ranchlands. One of the amicus, or &quot;friend of 

        the court,&quot; briefs was filed by the Office of the Attorney General 

        of the State of California; the second was filed by a coalition of nine 

        environmental groups concerned about San Diego's future. SOFAR has argued 

        that despite the passage of nearly four years since the court first ordered 

        it do so, the County has failed to comply with the California Environmental 

        Quality Act (&quot;CEQA&quot;) in approving the Environmental Impact Report 

        (&quot;EIR&quot;) for GPA 96-03. In asking the court to halt the Project, 

        SOFAR charged that &quot;if allowed to stand, the County's approach would 

        make a mockery not only of CEQA's core procedural requirements for good 

        faith effort at full disclosure of environmental impacts, but also of 

        CEQA's fundamental substantive requirement to avoid those impacts whenever 

        feasible.&quot;</p>

      <p>The Office of the Attorney General of the State of California, in its 

        amicus brief, strongly agreed with SOFAR: &quot;The EIR fails to provide 

        even the most minimal information about the specific impacts of GPA 96-03 

        on sensitive wildlife species.&quot; This approach, the brief added, &quot;would 

        eliminate a CEQA analysis when a project is expected to have significant 

        environmental impacts&quot; and thereby &quot;turn CEQA on its head.&quot; 

        The Attorney General's Office also criticized the EIR for its failure 

        to properly analyze measures that could have mitigated, or avoided, the 

        adverse impacts of the Project. Other agricultural counties have adopted 

        measures to avoid such impacts, as SOFAR had told the County, and &quot;the 

        County itself had information and policies that enable it to do the same.&quot; 

        The decision &quot;to disregard and dismiss [these] feasible mitigation 

        measures,&quot; the brief concluded, violates &quot;CEQA's requirement 

        to 'mitigate or avoid significant effects on the environment . . . whenever 

        it is feasible to do so.'&quot;</p>

      <p>The Office of the Attorney General also repeatedly emphasized the statewide 

        importance of this case, noting that &quot;the potential clearing and 

        grading of vast amounts of natural habitat in San Diego County . . . will 

        impair or destroy the state's biological resources, damaging habitats 

        utilized by numerous sensitive plant and animal species.&quot; The adverse 

        &quot;precedents set by the inadequate environmental review conducted 

        for the proposed project,&quot; the brief added, &quot;could have enormous 

        impact on the protection of natural habitats.&quot;</p>

      <p>The second amicus brief, authored by Professor Daniel P. Selmi, was filed 

        on behalf of a coalition of nine environmental groups, including California 

        Native Plant Society, California Oaks Foundation, Center for Biological 

        Diversity, Environmental Health Coalition, Mountain Defense League, San 

        Diego Audubon Society, San Diego BayKeeper, Sierra Club, and Surfrider 

        Foundation. These groups, which include both statewide and local organizations 

        concerned with San Diego County's future, charged that the County &quot;has 

        fundamentally misconceived its responsibilities under the California Environmental 

        Quality Act.&quot; The groups argued that the County had not engaged in 

        a &quot;good faith effort&quot; to gather all relevant information concerning 

        the general plan's significant impacts on biological and plant resources. 

        For example, the County &quot;made no effort to determine the project's 

        actual effects&quot; on endangered species, resulting in an &quot;utter 

        lack of detail&quot; concerning those effects.</p>

      <p>The environmental groups also accused the County of refusing to examine 

        mitigation measures that would lessen the project's significant environmental 

        impacts. The groups claimed that the County had illegally determined that 

        all mitigation measures were per se infeasible because they allegedly 

        would interfere with the &quot;purpose&quot; of the project. By doing 

        so, declared the groups, the County had illegally used this narrowly defined 

        purpose &quot;as a vehicle for avoiding the County's legal obligation 

        to identify and evaluate an array of mitigation measures that will eliminate 

        or reduce the project's significant impacts.&quot; Finally, the groups 

        requested the Court to overturn the County's decision because the County 

        &quot;has resisted full compliance with CEQA from the beginning of its 

        effort to approve this project.&quot; <br>
