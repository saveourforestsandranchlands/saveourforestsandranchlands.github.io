      <font size="2"><strong><u>JACUMBA VALLEY RANCH</u></strong></font> 

      <blockquote>The Planning Commission continued their hearing on Jacumba Valley Ranch from 

        January 21, 2000 to February 18, 2000. The major issue was the lack of 

        input from the Regional Water Quality Control Board in regards to the 

        major use permit application for a small wastewater treatment plant for 

        the project. This massive proposed project would put 1,048 dwelling units, 

        a 200-room hotel, golf course, congregate care facility, and commercial 

        area on 1,250 acres of farmland, including several hundred acres of prime 

        soil and wetlands. This huge project would overwhelm the rural town of 

        Jacumba and deplete their sole source of high-quality groundwater.</blockquote>



      <font size="2"><strong><u>RAMONA RIDGE ESTATES</u></strong></font> 

      <blockquote> The Planning Commission will hear on February 4, 2000 the project applicant’s 

        appeal of a Planning &amp; Environmental Review Board decision to require 

        an Environmental Impact Report for the project. The hearing was rescheduled 

        from January 21, 2000. This proposed project would subdivide 215 acres 

        of Agricultural Preserve grazing land into 18 housing lots with 8-acre 

        minimums. Half of Whale Mountain, a nesting site for a Golden Eagle pair, 

        occupies the eastern portion of the project site.</blockquote>



      <font size="2"><strong><u>GENERAL PLAN AMENDMENT 96-03</u></strong></font> 

      <blockquote>The Planning Commission will hold a hearing on GPA 96-03 on March 3, 2000. 

        This General Plan Amendment results from a successful lawsuit by SOFAR 

        against the County for not properly administered our Agricultural Preserve 

        (Ag 20) farmlands and open space. The County’s preferred alternative would 

        put 10-acre lot size minimums for subdivisions taking place within the 

        County Water Authority, and 40-acre lot size minimums outside the CWA. 

        SOFAR proposes 40-acre lots within the CWA, 80-acre lots outside the CWA, 

        and 10-acre lots where it can be proven that the soil is prime. SOFAR’s 

        proposal would meet the Williamson Act requirements for lot-size minimums 

        for agricultural preserve contracts. >This state act offers property tax 

        benefits for ranchers and farmers who agree not to subdivide their land 

        for at least 10 years. Our Agricultural Preserve (Ag 20) lands were set 

        up to more easily enter into Williamson Act contracts.</blockquote>
