      <blockquote>We need your support! On April 17th, 2002, our San Diego County Board 

        of Supervisors will be voting on an item that will decide the fate of 

        our backcountry. Specifically, the Board of Supervisors will be voting 

        on whether or not to &quot;rezone&quot; and divide almost 200,000 acres 

        of our pristine wildlands and ranchlands into 40-acre parcels. SOFAR strongly 

        believes that this &quot;rezone&quot; will promote &quot;ranchette&quot; 

        development of the last of our County's undeveloped lands. This &quot;ranchette&quot; 

        development will surely lead to the deterioration of the priceless natural 

        resources that we all depend on. The County's rezoning of San Diego's 

        backcountry is an unmitigable mistake and we must not allow this to happen. 

      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>As many of you already know, this item is known as GPA 96-03 (now GPA 

        01-01). It is scheduled for a hearing at the Board of Supervisors Wednesday, 

        April 17, 2002. The hearing begins at 9:00am, 96-03 is agenda item #2. 

        We need SOFAR supporters to attend this hearing! The most important comments 

        that you can make on this critical backcountry issue are: 1) this General 

        Plan Amendment allows for a great likelihood of subdividing our backcountry 

        for residential use (which we are strongly opposed to) and 2) the Environmental 

        Impact Report for 96-03 is inadequate in measuring residential impacts 

        upon the natural resources that reside in our backcountry. We have expert 

        testimony on the record that clearly states this project is a &quot;ranchette&quot;/sprawl 

        development plan that has not been properly analyzed by the county.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>Please call (619-230-1963) or email (sofar@nethere.net) us in the office 

        this week for more information regarding this critical backcountry issue. 

        And/or please refer to SOFAR's website (www.sofar.org) for an extensive 

        history of General Plan Amendment 96-03. </blockquote>

      <blockquote>Hearing Location: County Administration Center, 1600 Pacific Highway, 

        Room 310, San Diego.</blockquote>
