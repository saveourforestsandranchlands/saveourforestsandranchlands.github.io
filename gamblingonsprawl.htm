    <TD> <p>Testament to the fact that one cannot let down the guard against sprawl 

        and the establishment that, literally, paves the way for it, the backcountry 

        is faced with a new challenge against projects that are laying a bet on 

        the proven record of County officials to approve inappropriate development 

        in rural areas. In what threatens to become the I-15 of East County, County 

        officials are laying the foundation for a massive expansion of metropolitan 

        San Diego into the backcountry. </p>

      <p><br>

        Along the I-8 corridor, two chain-market retailers are moving forward 

        with plans to build large grocery complexes in Lakeside and Alpine. These 

        projects are not whimsical dreams of smalltime operators, however. They 

        are carefully calculated decisions made in expectation of the future growth 

        in demand in east county. Market studies (pardon the pun) show that the 

        communities in which these are being built cannot support the capacities 

        of the projects. </p>

      <p>These corporate powerhouses are betting on the proclivity of our land 

        use department to continue to approve sprawl-inducing projects and they&#8217;ll 

        be in the perfect position to profit from it. The odds are obviously in 

        their favor, look what happened between Mira Mesa and Escondido. Las Vegas, 

        or Viejas for that matter, couldn&#8217;t give better odds. </p>

      <p>Projects such as these not only change the face of rural areas but have 

        enormously devastating impacts on the character of the communities. Increasingly, 

        the costs associated with development outweigh the perceived benefits 

        of bringing conveniences to remote areas. Small business owners are often 

        wiped out by the invasion of corporate stores who can afford to sell under 

        priced goods until they dominate the marketplace; land, valued for its 

        natural and aesthetic qualities, or its generational ties to a family, 

        becomes cheapened as a speculative commodity; traffic and noise pollution 

        degrade the quality of life as development permeates the surrounding area 

        and the thoroughfares of the community. </p>

      <p>So how can the tide be stopped? What can be done? </p>

      <p>SOFAR has teamed up with three other local groups formed in opposition 

        to the project, Lakeside Preservation Coalition, Citizens For The Preservation 

        Of Alpine, and East County Trails Preservation Association. We&#8217;re 

        actively protesting these developments as well as the County&#8217;s predisposition 

        to approve projects like them that lead to the destruction of rural communities 

        by soliciting public support against the two granddaddies of these schemes, 

        Albertson&#8217;s and Ralph&#8217;s. </p>

      <p>Help us to battle these giants with a contribution to our campaign against 

        the Gamble on Sprawl. With your help, we can continue the fight to save 

        the backcountry by getting the message out to east county communities, 

        and hiring consultants to write professional comments on the projects. 

      </p>

      <p>The risk is real, we can&#8217;t afford to hope for the best and wait 

        and see what happens. Please help today.<br>
