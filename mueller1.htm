      <p>THE FAILED PROMISE OF HABITAT CONSERVATION PLANNING</p>

      <p>Originally published in Linkages, A publication of the Institute for 

        Ecological Health. Fall 1997.</p>

      <p>By Tara L. Mueller</p>

      <p>Director, Biodiversity Legal Program</p>

      <p>Environmental Law Foundation, Oakland, CA</p>

      <p>Multi-species habitat conservation plans (HCPs) have become the preferred, 

        if not the sole, mechanism for balancing endangered species conservation 

        with economic growth on private lands. In practice, however, multi-species 

        HCPs are literally paving the way for species' eventual extinction. 

        HCPs remove existing legal barriers to development of imperiled species' 

        habitat and lock in unsustainable levels of growth and resource extraction 

        and highly inadequate species mitigation measures. At the same time, HCPs 

        shift the entire future burden of protecting species and habitat from 

        those responsible for impacts to these species to the federal and state 

        taxpayers, while offering little long term conservation benefits in return.</p>

      <p>In an HCP development of endangered species habitat is authorized if 

        the project proponent prepares a conservation plan that outlines mitigation 

        measures sufficient to ensure that the species will be better off, and 

        at least no worse off, than before the development occurred. </p>

      <p>On a large scale, habitat conservation planning offers potential opportunities 

        to conduct scientifically based, landscape level, ecosystem planning by 

        protecting the most biologically valuable habitat, providing crucial migration 

        corridors, reducing habitat fragmentation and increasing habitat connectivity. 

      </p>

      <p>But to date these ideals have rarely, if ever, been achieved. The basic 

        problem: HCPs are political, not scientific documents, whose biological 

        integrity depends entirely upon the political influence of the plan proponent, 

        the political will of the approving wildlife agency, and the backbone 

        of the environmental community (who may or may not even be offered a seat 

        at the table). This basic problem is compounded by the fact that HCPs 

        are driven by a permit process which requires federal and state wildlife 

        agencies to authorize the destruction, not conservation, of species and 

        habitat - a fundamentally flawed mechanism for achieving species and habitat 

        protection goals.</p>

      <p>The HCP process also is fraught with numerous procedural inadequacies. 

        HCPs are typically prepared by industry or local government consultants, 

        with little or no independent scientific</p>

      <p>input, and often based on minimal scientific information. Not one HCP 

        approved to date has been scientifically peer reviewed. Many HCPs are 

        negotiated by government and permit applicant behind closed doors. By 

        the time the draft HCP and environmental documentation are circulated 

        for a brief period of public review, the &quot;deal&quot; has already 

        been made.</p>

      <p>HCPs approved or prepared to date fall far short of standards necessary 

        to ensure the continued</p>

      <p>survival, let alone recovery, of imperiled species. For example, HCPs 

        do not usually include measurable biological criteria or species-specific 

        management actions and mitigation measures. The do not quantify the level 

        of take expected to occur, or adequately account for cumulative impacts 

        to species across their range. Most approved HCPs permit immediate take 

        and significant net losses of biologically valuable occupied habitat in 

        exchange for vaguely defined management of marginal habitat set asides. 

        HCPs also contain ineffective monitoring programs that evaluate only general 

        habitat conditions, and not population trends, for a few indicator species. 

        Some HCP mitigation programs simply rely on mere compliance with existing 

        law, or on uncertain federal land management actions. In response to landowners' 

        unsupported claims of financial infeasibility, federal wildlife agencies 

        further reduce HCP mitigation requirements to those that are &quot;practicable.&quot; 

        Funding for critical land and water acquisitions and future monitoring 

        and adaptive management programs usually is not assured.</p>

      <p>But perhaps the most problematic aspect of HCPs is the Clinton Administration's 

        controversial &quot;no surprises&quot; policy. This policy locks in the 

        inadequate species protection measures in HCPs, relieving landowners of 

        any future obligation to provide additional meaningful mitigation measures, 

        for decades of time. Instead, federal and state taxpayers bear this burden. 

      </p>

      <p>The problem is that no money has been or is likely to be set aside for 

        the federal and state governments to meet this substantial new obligation. 

        So the species themselves bear the risk of an inadequate HCP, directly 

        contrary to the purpose of the ESA. Although the no surprises policy is 

        very likely illegal under the current ESA, environmentalists have yet 

        to challenge the policy on substantive grounds. </p>

      <p>In sum, the promise of HCPs as the panacea for endangered species conservation 

        on non-federal lands has not materialized. Instead, as currently implemented, 

        HCPs are highly likely accelerate species extinctions by absolving non-federal 

        landowners of virtually all responsibility for protecting imperiled species 

        in exchange for minimal conservation actions. In order for HCPs to achieve 

        their purported goal of balancing the needs of vanishing wildlife and 

        habitat with ever</p>

      <p>increasing growth and resource extraction, they must incorporate far 

        more meaningful biological protections for species and far fewer regulatory 

        assurances for developers and industries. </p></TD>
