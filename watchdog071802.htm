  	<TD><p><strong><u>THANK YOU SOFAR SUPPORTERS!</u></strong></p>

      <blockquote>Thank you for all of your contributions to SOFAR's annual fund drive. 

        The response to our appeal has been running very strong. This is a critical 

        time for regional planning issues as confirmed by the latest San Diego 

        poll showing that housing, traffic and beach pollution are the public's 

        top concerns. With your help, SOFAR will continue to insist that a regional 

        Urban Growth Boundary is the only realistic way to plan for a sustainable 

        future and to combat the thousands of sprawl projects that keep undermining 

        all of our planning efforts. We will keep you posted on our progress!</blockquote>

      <p><strong><u>SOFAR'S VICTORY IN PINE VALLEY</u></strong></p>

      <blockquote>Residents of Pine Valley, a rural area bordered on four sides by the 

        Cleveland National Forest in eastern San Diego County, were appalled recently 

        to learn of AT&amp;T&#8217;s proposal to build a fiber optic amplification 

        facility in the heart of their rustic residential neighborhood. The proposed 

        project, which would involve the construction of a substantial structure 

        posing the threat of a noise nuisance, was clearly at odds with County 

        General Plan policies governing &#8220;one of the most scenic areas in 

        the County.&#8221; Having lost the first administrative round, local residents 

        turned to Save Our Forest &amp; Ranchlands for help.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>We were able to retain the law firm of Shute, Mihaly, &amp; Weinberger 

        in San Francisco who argued not only that the large and noisy facility 

        would violate the County General Plan, but also that it plainly did not 

        fit within the zoning policies governing the area. Supportive of AT&amp;T&#8217;s 

        proposal, County staff had claimed that the project was an allowable &#8220;civic 

        support facility for the local populace,&#8221; and suggested that it 

        was &#8220;strongly vested with public or social importance.&#8221; The 

        firm was able to demonstrate that the amplification station would not 

        serve Pine Valley&#8217;s residents and visitors, but rather would provide 

        high-speed data transmission services to AT&amp;T network service customers 

        outside of the area. Far from a civic use, the proposed facility was simply 

        a commercial enterprise benefiting AT&amp;T shareholders and customers. 

      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>On March 21, 2002, a phalanx of AT&amp;T lawyers and other consultants 

        appeared at the San Diego County Board of Appeal, ready to walk away with 

        the necessary permit. It was not to be. By unanimous vote, the Commission 

        concluded that the Pine Valley neighborhood was not the best site for 

        a noisy generator, and granted the SOFAR appeal. </blockquote>

      <blockquote>Sound land use planning carried the day, but the dust had hardly settled 

        when the County announced a scheme to have the AT&amp;T project move into 

        an unused restaurant building next to the site just rejected by the Commissioners. 

        Stay tuned&#8230;</blockquote>

      <p><strong><u>SOFAR'S UPCOMING BATTLES</u></strong></p>

      <blockquote> As many of you already know, SOFAR is currently engaged in a highly 

        publicized battle with a proposed Albertson's project in Alpine. The Alpine 

        Planning Group has approved Albertson's Environmental Impact Report, so 

        the next step in this project will be at the San Diego Planning Commission 

        in approximately two to three months. </blockquote>

      <blockquote> The Lakeside Ralph's supermarket strip-mall project EIR is due to be 

        released this month and we are gearing up to oppose it. </blockquote>

      <blockquote> The Ralph's project is connected with the adjacent 200 home subdivision 

        proposed on 600 acres of prime avocado groves (see photos on our website www.sofar.org). </blockquote>

      <blockquote>We will keep you informed as these battles develop!</blockquote>

      <p><strong><u>SOFAR WILL BE LOSING UNIQUE DOWNTOWN OFFICE</u></strong></p>

      <blockquote>Due to Ballpark redevelopment, SOFAR is looking for a new affordable 

        office space. If any of our supporters have creative ideas, please let 

        us know. We need to relocate as soon as possible!</blockquote>

      <p><strong><u>CHECK OUT OUR IMPROVED WEBSITE!</u></strong></p>

      <blockquote>SOFAR has begun updating our website by including photographs of project 

        sites around the County. Please take a look http://www.sofar.org/projects.htm 

        and please help us by sending photographs of project sites in your community. 

        Our goal is to build a photographic archive of what kinds of natural and 

        agricultural resources are being destroyed and developed.</blockquote>
