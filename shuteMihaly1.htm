      <p><strong>Re: Environmental Impact Report for Agricultural Issues General 

        Plan Amendment and Implementing Rezone (GPA 96-03)</strong></p>

      <p>Dear Chair Jacob and Members of the Board:</p>

      <p>We submit this letter on behalf of Save Our Forest and Ranchlands (SOFAR), 

        an organization dedicated to the protection of the wilderness, watershed, 

        and agricultural resources of San Diego County, and the California Oak 

        Foundation, an organization dedicated to the protection and preservation 

        of the state's oak forest ecosystem. Both SOFAR and the California Oak 

        Foundation are committed to curbing costly urban sprawl, preserving rural 

        habitats and landscapes, while at the same time ensuring that our cities 

        remain livable.</p>

      <p>The purpose of this letter is to inform the San Diego County Board of 

        Supervisors that the environmental impact report (EIR) for the County's 

        proposed amendments to its General Plan (hereinafter &quot;proposed project&quot;) 

        fails to comply with the requirements of the California Environmental 

        Quality Act (&quot;CEQA&quot;), Public Resources Code &sect; 2 1 000 et 

        seq., and the CEQA Guidelines, California Code of Regulations, title 14, 

        &sect; 15000 et seq. (&quot;CEQA Guidelines&quot;). In addition, approval 

        of the proposed project would render the San Diego County General Plan 

        internally inconsistent.</p>

      <p><strong>I. INTRODUCTION</strong></p>

      <p>The County proposes to adopt a general plan amendment and implementing 

        rezoning to respond to a judgment of the Superior Court of San Diego County 

        issued as a result of a lawsuit, brought against the County by SOFAR. 

        The County proposes to redesignate 200,000 acres of land to a 10- or 40 

        acre minimum parcel size depending on the lands' proximity to the County 

        Water Authority boundary. The DEIR assumes for &#8220;worst case analysis&quot; 

        purposes, that all of the Agricultural Preserve Designation (hereinafter 

        identified as &quot;(20) lands&quot;), including the native vegetation, 

        would be cleared for agriculture. The EIR concludes that, as a result 

        of this massive clearing, the project would result in significant impacts 

        upon biological, geological, water, visual and cultural/paleontological 

        resources, air quality, transportation/circulation, and noise. DEIR at 

        ES-3.</p>

      <p>Assuming that all 200,000 acres would be cleared, we concur that the 

        County has no choice but to label impacts as significant. Yet it is this 

        exact issue -- the cavalier view that all lands would have to be cleared 

        purportedly to promote agricultural uses -- that we find the most disturbing. 

        In our opinion, the EIR misleads the public and decision-makers by implying 

        that the protection of agricultural lands must come at the expense of 

        the environment. This is simply not the case. Indeed, we are unaware of 

        any other jurisdiction in the state that threatens the annihilation of 

        entire populations of sensitive wildlife and vegetation to &quot;facilitate 

        agricultural uses.&quot; SOFAR and the California Oak Foundation have 

        a long history of supporting the promotion of agricultural uses within 

        the County and, in the case of the Foundation, throughout the state. Yet, 

        these organizations are most concerned that the County's proposed approach 

        would purportedly promote agricultural uses while imposing environmental 

        damage on a huge proportion on the County's sensitive habitats.</p>

      <p> The EIR prepared in connection with this drastic proposal is woefully 

        inadequate in a number of respects. First, the EIR's discussion of impacts 

        to biological resources is deficient and misleading in that it consists 

        of a single chart, buried in a technical appendix, which reveals the numerous 

        rare, threatened and endangered species existing on the lands that the 

        EIR suggests could be cleared. The EIR text does not address the subject; 

        and, more important, the document nowhere mentions the actual and specific 

        consequences to these sensitive species,, including impacts to oak forest 

        ecosystems, resulting from the clearing of 200,000 acres of sensitive 

        habitat. Second, the EIR comes to the troubling conclusion that the plethora 

        of significant impacts resulting from the project could not be mitigated 

        because it would just be too expensive. Finally, the EIR contains no analysis 

        of the cumulative impacts to biological resources. Because the EIR is 

        so clearly inadequate, a revised draft EIR that corrects its numerous 

        deficiencies must be prepared and circulated for public review. Only then 

        can the public and the decision-makers be adequately informed of the environmental 

        impacts of the proposed project.</p>

      <p>In addition, approval of the proposed project would render the County's 

        General Plan internally inconsistent. The General Plan establishes a Resource 

        Conservation Area (&quot;RCA&quot;) overlay that is intended to conserve 

        the County's unique resources. Far from preserving the County's natural 

        resources within the RCA overlay areas, the proposed amendments to the 

        County's General Plan would allow for the complete clearing of 200,000 

        acres of (20) lands, many of which are likely to be subject to the RCA 

        overlay.</p>

      <p>SOFAR and its consultants have participated for almost four years in 

        the County's planning process relating to agricultural lands, and have 

        provided extensive comments on the DEIR for the current project. See, 

        e.g., letter from Duncan McFetridge, dated December 5, 1999, and letters 

        from Richard Grassetti, dated November 4, 1996 and March 29, 1999. Other 

        members of the public, environmental organizations and regulatory agencies 

        also have provided detailed comments on the DEIR, including the U.S. Department 

        of the Interior's Fish and Wildlife Service, the California Department 

        of Fish and Game, and the Endangered Habitats League. See ' e.g., letter 

        dated April 5, 1999 from Sheryl L. Barrett and Bill Tippets, U.S. Fish 

        and Wildlife Service and the California Department of Fish and Game; and 

        letter from Dan Silver, Endangered Habitats League, dated April 2, 1999. 

        Upon review of the FEIR, it became immediately clear that the County had 

        not corrected the manifold deficiencies in the DEIR, and so this firm 

        now provides the following summary of the CEQA violations evident in the 

        County's final environmental document.</p>

      <p><strong>II. THE EIR FAILS TO COMPLY WITH CEQA.</strong></p>

      <p><strong>A. The EIR Fails to Adequately Disclose or Analyze Significant 

        Impacts Upon the County's Sensitive Biological Resources.</strong></p>

      <p> The EIR concludes that the potential clearing of all of the (20) lands 

        would result in significant impacts upon biological, geological, water, 

        visual and cultural/ paleontological resources, air quality, transportation/circulation 

        and noise. DEIR at ES-3. We concur that the County has no choice but to 

        label impacts as significant. The EIR, however, violates CEQA in failing 

        to adequately analyze these admittedly significant impacts. CEQA requires 

        that an EIR must be detailed, complete, and reflect a good faith effort 

        at full disclosure. CEQA Guidelines &sect; 15151. The document should 

        provide a sufficient degree of analysis to inform the public about the 

        proposed project's adverse environmental impacts and to allow decision-makers 

        to make intelligent judgments. Id. Consistent with this requirement, the 

        information regarding the project's impacts must be &#8220;painstakingly 

        ferreted out.&quot; Environmental Planning and Information Council of 

        Western El Dorado County v. County of El Dorado, 131 Cal.App.3d 350, 357 

        (1982) (finding an EIR for a general plan amendment inadequate where the 

        document did not make clear the effect on the physical environment).</p>

      <p>The EIR's treatment of biological impacts does not come close to meeting 

        this legal standard. Indeed, the &quot;analysis&quot; includes only a 

        technical appendix, listing the state and federally listed species that 

        have been found or are expected to be found on the (20) lands. See FEIR 

        Appendix F. The chart identifies multiple California and federally listed 

        threatened and endangered plant and animal species, including, but not 

        limited to, the Southwestern willow flycatcher, Least Bell's vireo, California 

        thornmint, Dehesa beargrass, Arroyo toad, and the Quino checkerspot butterfly. 

        Yet, despite the County's awareness of the numerous threatened and endangered 

        species on (20) lands, the EIR text never mentions, let alone analyzes, 

        the actual and specific consequences to these sensitive species resulting 

        from the clearing of 200,000 acres of sensitive habitat. The document 

        makes no attempt, for example, to quantify the expected losses to species 

        and habitat, to identify the location of important habitat areas, to identify 

        the specific species that would be impacted, and, finally, to analyze 

        the significance of the expected impacts in light of these facts.</p>

      <p>Meaningful analysis effectuates one of CEQA's fundamental purposes: to 

        &quot;inform the public and responsible officials of the environmental 

        consequences of their decisions before they are made.&quot; Laurel Heights 

        Improvement Ass'n v. Regents of the University of California, 6 Cal.4th 

        11 12, 1123 (1993) (Laurel Heights II). To accomplish this purpose, an 

        EIR must contain facts an-d analysis, not just an agency's bare conclusions. 

        Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Board of Superisors, 52 Cal.3d 553, 568(1990). 

        Thus, a conclusion regarding the significance of an environmental impact 

        that is not based on an analysis of the relevant facts fails to fulfill 

        CEQA's informational goal. The County's EIR fails to fulfill this paramount 

        CEQA purpose both because it neglects to present all relevant facts relating 

        to the project's impact upon biological resources and because its cursory 

        conclusions are based upon no analysis. Accordingly, wildlife biologists 

        have harshly criticized the lack of detail in the DEIR, indicating that 

        it fails to analyze the potentially massive negative impacts the general 

        plan amendment will have on biodiversity in (20) lands. See Letter from 

        James, E. Diffendorfer, Ph.D., Vertebrate Conservation Biologist, dated 

        April 5, 1999.</p>

      <p>Although the County's environmental review includes no analysis of potential 

        impacts, it nonetheless concludes that project impacts would be significant. 

        CEQA requires, however, that an EIR must not only identify the impacts, 

        but also provide &quot;information about how adverse the impacts will 

        be.&quot; Santiago County Water District v. County of Orange,118Cal.App.3d8l8,831(1981). 

        Contrary to authority, the EIR declines to provide an actual analysis 

        of these impacts, claiming that due to the expansive 191,000-acre project 

        site, detailed biological studies were not conducted and that it is not 

        possible to assess impacts until a development proposal is prepared for 

        a specific project. FEIR at 65, Response F2 and page 50, Response C45. 

        Yet, under applicable state law, the County cannot evade its obligation 

        to conduct environmental review on the basis that the environmental impacts 

        would be extensive. Following this convoluted reasoning, the greater the 

        environmental harm contemplated by an agency, the lesser the obligation 

        of conducting environmental review. The California Supreme Court has clearly 

        rejected such an approach. As explained by the Court in Laurel Heights 

        Improvement Ass'n of San Francisco v. Regents of the University of California, 

        47 Cal-3d 376, 399 (1988) (Laurel Heights 1), &quot;[w]e find no authority 

        that exempts an agency from complying with the law, environmental or otherwise, 

        merely because the agency's task may be difficult.&quot;</p>

      <p>The County's EIR further attempts to justify its refusal to undertake 

        environmental analysis by the claim that a parcel-level analysis is neither 

        feasible nor necessary when evaluating impacts of a General Plan change. 

        FEIR at 65, Response F2. Yet, the County does not ever intend to conduct 

        the necessary environmental analysis. As will be explained in the mitigation 

        section below, the EIR very clearly indicates that there will be no further 

        environmental review even if all of the 200,000 acres of (20) lands are 

        cleared for agricultural purposes. EIR at 2-104 and 67, Response F6. Under 

        these circumstances -- and especially where the EIR concludes the impacts 

        will be significant -&shy;the environmental impact analysis must be performed 

        now. As the Court of Appeal recently explained in Stanislaus Natural Heritage 

        Project v. County of Stanislaus, 48 Cal.App. 4th 182 (1996), CEQA requires 

        that this environmental review take place before project approval. Id. 

        at 196 (citing Laurel Heights II for the proposition that a &quot;fundamental 

        purpose&quot; of CEQA is to ... inform the public and responsible officials 

        of the environmental consequences of their decisions before they are made 

        ... ). In Stanislaus, the court rejected the argument that a programmatic 

        EIR for a specific plan and general plan amendment could ignore site-specific 

        environmental review because future phases of the development project 

        would include environmental review, stating that &quot;'tiering' is not 

        a device for deferring the identification of significant environmental 

        impacts that the adoption of a specific plan can be expected to cause.&quot; 

        Id. at 199. The court emphasized that agencies should expect environmental 

        analysis to involve some degree of forecasting:</p>

      <p>We do not by this opinion place any new burdens on preparers of EIRS. 

        Our opinion today is merely an affirmation of already existing law. &quot;Drafting 

        an EIR ... necessarily involves some degree of forecasting. While forecasting 

        the unforeseeable is not possible, an agency must use its best efforts 

        to find out and disclose all that it reasonably can.&quot; Id. at 206, 

        citing CEQA Guidelines &sect; 15144.'</p>

      <p>'Where courts have not required analysis of future environmental effects, 

        there has been subsequent environmental review. See, e.g., Big Rock Mesas 

        Property Owners Ass'n v. Board of Supervisors, 73 Cal.App.3d 218, 228, 

        139 Cal. Rptr. 445 (1977) (upholding an EIR for explorational geothermal 

        drilling that failed to included analysis of impacts associated with potential 

        commercial development where &quot;[p]rior to development of Phase II, 

        additional approvals and more detailed environmental documentation would 

        be required&quot;); No Oil, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles, 196 Cal.App.3d 

        223, 232-238, 242 Cal. Rptr. 37 (1987) (&quot;No Oil II&quot;) (upholding 

        an EIR for exploratory oil drilling that failed to include detailed discussion 

        of oil pipeline routes where these subsequent aspects of the project would 

        be subject to independent environmental review). As mentioned above, the 

        County expects no subsequent review to occur before (20) lands are developed 

        for agricultural uses.</p>

      <p>At the same time, CEQA requires that project descriptions and environmental 

        impact assessments account for reasonably foreseeable future phases, or 

        other reasonably foreseeable consequences of proposed projects. Laurel 

        Heights I at 393&shy;399. In Laurel Heights I, the California Supreme 

        Court required that an EIR analyze future effects of project expansion 

        or other action where &quot;(1) it is a reasonably foreseeable consequence 

        of the initial project; and (2) the future expansion or action will be 

        significant in that it will likely change the scope or nature of the initial 

        project or its environmental effects.&quot; Id. at 396. In that case, 

        the court required the University's EIR to discuss the future expansion 

        of its project in order to inform decision-makers and the public about 

        the impacts that would likely occur. Id. In the instant case, environmental 

        review is even more clearly required, as agricultural development of the 

        (20) lands is not an &quot;expansion&quot; of the original project, but 

        rather the precise purpose of the project now under consideration.</p>

      <p>In sum, the EIR's discussion of biological resources is incomplete, misleading 

        and unsupported by necessary analysis. In light of the flaws identified 

        above, the EIR must be substantially revised and recirculated before the 

        County can properly consider approving this project. Given the nature 

        and severity of potential project impacts, the County must conduct detailed 

        and comprehensive studies. A meaningful analysis would include, for example, 

        site-specific biological surveys to identify the location and quality 

        of sensitive habitat, and a detailed review of these surveys to identify 

        avoidance areas. An adequate analysis would also include specific information 

        about which species would be impacted by the increased activity, the consequences 

        to wildlife of being unable to use the project site as habitat, and the 

        consequences to wildlife species of being isolated from their feeding 

        and watering areas.</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p><strong>B. The EIR Fails to Identify Feasible Measures to Mitigate the 

        Project's Significant Biological Impacts.</strong></p>

      <p> CEQA requires that mitigation measures be identified and analyzed. &quot;The 

        purpose of an environmental impact report is ... to list ways in which 

        the significant effects of such a project might be minimized . . . .&quot; 

        CEQA &sect; 21061. The Supreme Court has described the mitigation and 

        alternative sections of the EIR as the &quot;core&quot; of the document. 

        Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Board of Supervisors, 52 Cal. 3d 553 (1990).</p>

      <p>In the present case, the EIR's failure to conduct an analysis of the 

        impacts to biological resources renders it unable to identify proper mitigation 

        for such impacts or to propose alternatives that could alleviate them. 

        Amazingly, the EIR identifies exactly one mitigation measure. This measure 

        would require the County to amend its grading ordinance, to require discretionary 

        review of all agricultural grading, brushing and clearing. FEIR at 2-102. 

        Yet, instead of evaluating this measure, the EIR summarily dismisses it 

        as &quot;'infeasible,&quot; claiming that the environmental review resulting 

        from discretionary actions would be a financial burden for farmers and 

        cause time delays to agricultural operations. FEIR at 53, Response C56. 

        This cursory approach is unsupportable under the law.</p>

      <p>CEQA requires that an agency conclusion that mitigation is infeasible 

        must be supported by substantial evidence. CEQA &sect;&sect; 21081, 21081.5. 

        Yet, the EIR here provides no evidence whatsoever to support its conclusion 

        that the regulation of agricultural operations is infeasible. In fact, 

        numerous counties throughout the state, including, for instance, Santa 

        Barbara, Lake and Sonoma counties, have adopted agricultural grading ordinances 

        with the express purpose of preventing environmental damage. For example, 

        Lake County's grading ordinance requires discretionary approval of a grading 

        permit and environmental review pursuant to CEQA under several circumstances, 

        including, but not limited to, the following: (1) when grading occurs 

        within 30 feet of the top of the bank or within the riparian canopy of 

        a stream, lake, vernal pool, wetland, or designated floodway; (2) when 

        grading occurs involving the clearing of more than 10,000 square feet 

        of native vegetation; (3) when grading occurs which in the opinion of 

        the Building Official clearly has a potential for significant environmental 

        impact. See Lake County Ordinance No. 2218, dated January 5, 1994, attached 

        to this comment letter. The adoption of grading ordinances by agencies 

        such as Lake County demonstrates the feasibility of mitigating the impacts 

        of grading on sensitive habitats.</p>

      <p>It is noteworthy that the precise reasons stated for rejecting mitigation 

        measures dramatically demonstrate that the County knows it has not adequately 

        analyzed project impacts. The County expressly concedes that to adequately 

        mitigate project impacts it would first be necessary to &quot;map the 

        biologically important lands to determine what lands have biological resources 

        worth protecting.&quot; FEIR at 77, Response F42. The EIR goes on to state 

        that mapping must be done on a regional basis to get an accurate assessment 

        of the significance of biological resources:</p>

      <p>For example, biological resources that are connected to other resources 

        on other lands may [sic] more important than those that are not connected. 

        Also, the value of a particular biological resource is affected by the 

        value of other biological resources in the surrounding area ... [and] 

        [m]apping just the (20) lands would not provide an accurate assessment 

        of the significance of the biological resources on these lands.</p>

      <p>Id. The fact that the County recognizes the need for future mapping and 

        studies demonstrates the substantive inadequacies of the County's environmental 

        review. Moreover, the County may not use the failure of its review to 

        avoid mitigation: &quot;The agency should not be allowed to hide behind 

        its own failure to collect data.&quot; Robert Sundstrom v. County of Mendocino, 

        202 Cal.App.3d 296, 361 (1988).</p>

      <p>The EIR's discussion of mitigation measures was universally criticized 

        by resource regulatory agencies, wildlife biologists, and environmental 

        organizations. For example, in a detailed comment letter on the DEIR decrying 

        the project's profound impact on the County's natural resources, the U.S. 

        Fish and Wildlife Service and the California Department of Fish and Game 

        stated that there are certainly feasible mitigation measures that the 

        County could implement to minimize impacts to biological resources. See 

        Letter by Sheryl L. Barrett and Bill Tippets, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 

        and the California Department of Fish and Game and dated April 5, 1999. 

        The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Department of Fish and Game 

        urged the County to adopt stronger policies and implementation measures 

        which would require avoidance of impacts where agricultural uses could 

        adversely affect identified sensitive habitats and species, and larger 

        parcel size requirements in areas of high habitat values. FEIR at 68, 

        Response F6. The EIR sidesteps this request by asserting that it has low 

        expectations for agricultural expansion in the (20) lands in the short 

        term outside of the CWA boundary. Yet the agricultural expansion into, 

        and the complete grading and clearing of, these lands are exactly what 

        is contemplated by the County under the proposed project. The EIR provides 

        no other basis for the rejection of this feasible mitigation measure.</p>

      <p>When these same resource agencies requested that the County consider 

        other measures including specific criteria for locating residences and 

        structures away from sensitive resources and clustering and density transfer 

        revisions, the County again p</p>

      <p>skirts its obligation to mitigate impacts, arguing that sensitive habitats 

        are found in so many areas of the County there would likely be.numerous 

        situations where avoidance and set-back requirements could not be met. 

        FEIR at 76, Response F-42. Here again, the County relies on the startling 

        and unsupportable premise that it has no obligation to protect sensitive 

        species because the environmental harm resulting from this project is 

        so potentially severe.</p>

      <p>Indeed, for each and every mitigation measure suggested by regulatory 

        agencies and other members of the public, the County concludes that the 

        measure would be infeasible because it would be too expensive or result 

        in time delays for farmers. Yet, the County offers no substantiation, 

        factually or legally, for this novel theory for avoiding necessary mitigation 

        and, of course, the County's position is contrary to law. See, Laurel 

        Heights 1, 47 Cal.3d at 400 (discussing the importance of mitigation and 

        alternatives analysis and indicating that alternatives must be discussed 

        even if they would &quot;impede to some degree the attainment of the project 

        objectives, or would be more costly&quot;).</p>

      <p>The EIR's failure to adequately identify feasible mitigation renders 

        the EIR inadequate for certification. The revised EIR must base its analysis 

        on something more than a cursory summary of impacts and must describe 

        specific mitigation measures and their expected effectiveness to ensure 

        that the public and County decision-makers have a clear understanding 

        of the environmental harm associated with this project, and how such harm 

        might be avoided.</p>

      <p><strong>C. The EIR Fails to Adequately Identify and Analyze the Project's 

        Cumulative Impacts.</strong></p>

      <p> An EIR must discuss significant &quot;cumulative impacts.&quot; CEQA 

        Guidelines &sect; 15130(a). &quot;Cumulative impacts&quot; are defined 

        as &quot;two or more individual effects which, when considered together, 

        are considerable or which compound or increase other environmental impacts.&quot; 

        CEQA Guidelines &sect; 15355(a). &quot;[I]ndividual effects may be changes 

        resulting from a single project or a number of separate projects.&quot; 

        CEQA Guidelines &sect; 15355(a). A legally adequate &quot;cumulative impacts 

        analysis&quot; views a particular project over time and in conjunction 

        with other related past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future projects 

        whose impacts might compound or interrelate with those of the project 

        at hand. &quot;Cumulative impacts can result from individually minor but 

        collectively significant projects taking place over a period of time.&quot; 

        CEQA Guidelines &sect; 15355(b). The cumulative impacts concept recognizes 

        that &quot;[t]he full environmental impact of a proposed ... action cannot 

        be gauged in a vacuum.&quot; Whitman v. Board of Supervisors, 88 Cal-App.3d 

        397, 408 (1979).</p>

      <p>A cumulative impacts analysis is especially important in the present 

        case because scientists studying declines in biodiversity agree that San 

        Diego County is in the midst of a biological crisis. The County, as a 

        part of the Southern California region, contains a greater diversity of 

        vertebrates and endemic species than any other region in the United States. 

        See Letter from James E. Diffendorfer, Ph.D., Vertebrate Conservation 

        Biologist, dated April 5, 1999, contained in the FEIR. In recent years, 

        poorly planned development has resulted in the loss of valuable habitat 

        and has placed a large number of endangered species and entire ecosystems 

        at risk of extirpation within the County. Id.</p>

      <p>Because of the fundamental importance of the 200,000 acres of (20) lands 

        in maintaining t he region's biodiversity, the EIR should have carefully 

        analyzed the cumulative impacts of this loss of habitat together with 

        other habitat loss in the County and the Southern California region. The 

        need for such analysis is compelling given the County's own admission 

        that conservation scientists are particularly concerned about the changes 

        in native landscapes, habitat fragmentation, disruption of landscape linkages 

        and wildlife corridors, and biodiversity as a consequence of development 

        and other forms of resource use. FEIR at 2-76.</p>

      <p>Incredibly, the EIR for the present project contains no analysis whatsoever 

        of the project's cumulative impact upon biological resources. Instead, 

        it merely states that &quot;future subdivisions and other discretionary 

        projects would be subject to CEQA and various other County ordinances 

        that require subsequent environmental review and mitigation for the loss 

        of biological resources.&quot; EIR at 3-5. The failure to conduct any 

        cumulative impacts analysis is especially disconcerting given that this 

        is a program-level EIR that should appropriately focus on cumulative impacts. 

        See CEQA Guidelines &sect; 15168(b)(4) (consideration of broad policy 

        alternatives and program mitigation measures at this early stage when 

        agency has greater flexibility to deal with cumulative impacts). Moreover, 

        it is especially disturbing that the EIR implies that the County will 

        conduct subsequent environmental review when it has already clearly asserted 

        that any type of development associated with agricultural activity would 

        not be a discretionary act, and therefore would not be subject to CEQA.</p>

      <p>Even were subsequent environmental review available, CEQA requires early 

        identification of significant effects, alternatives, and mitigation. Pub. 

        Res.Code &sect; 21003.1 The Supreme Court finds it to be a &quot;basic 

        tenet of CEQA&quot; that, once sufficient information is available, &quot;an 

        environmental analysis should be prepared as early as feasible in the 

        planning process to enable environmental considerations to influence project 

        program and design.&quot; Laurel Heights I, 47 Cal.3d at 395. The Court 

        clearly rejected the idea that definite plans were required for an early 

        analysis. Id. at 396.</p>

      <p>In short, this General Plan level environmental document is the appropriate 

        forum for a detailed analysis of the project's cumulative impacts. The 

        County must revise the EIR to include this analysis.</p>

      <p><strong>D. The EIR Should Be Redrafted and Recirculated.</strong></p>

      <p> CEQA requires recirculation of a revised draft EIR &quot;[w]hen significant 

        new information is added to an environmental impact report&quot; after 

        public review and comment on the earlier draft EIR. Pub. Res. Code &sect; 

        21092. 1. The opportunity for meaningful public review of significant 

        new information is essential &quot;to test, assess, and evaluate the data 

        and make an informed judgment as to the validity of the conclusions to 

        be drawn therefrom.&quot; Sutter Sensible Planning, Inc. v. Sutter County 

        Board of Supervisors, 122 Cal.App.3d 813, 822 (1981); City of San Jose 

        v. Great Oaks Water Co., 192 Cal-App-3d 1005, 1017 (1987). An agency cannot 

        simply release a draft report &quot;that hedges on important environmental 

        issues while deferring a more detailed analysis to the final [EIR] that 

        is insulated from public review.&quot; Mountain Lion Coalition v. California 

        Fish and Game Comm'n, 214 Cal.App.3d 1043, 1053 (1989).</p>

      <p>In order to cure the panoply of EIR defects identified in this letter, 

        the County will have to obtain substantial new information to adequately 

        assess the proposed project's environmental impacts, and to identify effective 

        mitigation and alternatives capable of alleviating the project's significant 

        impacts. CEQA requires that the public have a meaningful opportunity to 

        review and comment upon this significant new information in the form of 

        a recirculated draft EIR.</p>

      <p><strong>III. APPROVAL OF THE PROJECT WOULD RENDER THE GENERAL PLAN INTERNALLY 

        INCONSISTENT.</strong></p>

      <p>Government Code section 65300.5 provides that the &quot;Legislature intends 

        that the general plan and elements and parts thereof comprise an integrated, 

        internally consistent and compatible statement of policies for the adopting 

        agency.&quot; Courts have routinely noted that &quot;[t]he requirement 

        of consistency is the linchpin of Califomia's land use and development 

        laws; it is the principle which infused the concept of planned growth 

        with the force of law.&quot; deBottari v. Norco City Council, 171 Cal.App.3d 

        1204, 1213, 217 Cal. Rptr. 790, 795 (1985).</p>

      <p>Approval of the County's proposed amendments to the General Plan would 

        render the General Plan internally inconsistent because the project contemplates 

        the complete clearing of 200,000 acres of (20) lands, much of which was 

        intended to be protected by the County as evidenced by the General Plan 

        Conservation Element. The Conservation Element is a comprehensive document 

        that contains findings, goals, policies and action programs devoted to 

        the importance of preserving the County's native plants and wildlife. 

        See Conservation Element Chapter 4 (Vegetation and Wildlife Habitats) 

        at X-37. The General Plan establishes a Resource Conservation Area (&quot;RCA&quot;) 

        overlay which is intended to provide special attention to conserve the 

        County's unique resources. Id. at X-13. The RCA overlay contains numerous 

        implementation actions designed to protect, conserve and enhance native 

        vegetation and wildlife. Id. at X-13 and X-14.</p>

      <p>Although the County's EIR does not identify how much of the (20) lands 

        area is subject to the RCA overlay, it is likely to be a substantial amount 

        since, according to the EIR, native vegetation communities exist on the 

        majority of lands in the (20) area. FEIR at 2-70. Far from preserving 

        the County's natural resources within the RCA overlay areas, the proposed 

        amendments to the County's General Plan would allow for the complete clearing 

        of 200,000 acres of (20) lands. Although the EIR recognizes that the project's 

        impacts to vegetative and wildlife would be significant, it fails to consider 

        adopting and implementing the action measures included in the Conservation 

        Element specifically designed to protect native vegetation and wildlife. 

        Such actions include public acquisition, establishment of open space easements, 

        application of special land use controls such as cluster zoning, large-lot 

        zoning, and natural resource preservation overlay zones. Conservation 

        Element at X-13. As discussed above, the resource regulatory agencies 

        requested that the County implement large lot zoning and clustering provisions 

        to mitigate the project's significant impacts upon vegetation and wildlife. 

        The County rejects these mitigation measures, claiming only that they 

        would pose a financial burden and would result in time delays to farmers.</p>

      <p>The Conservation Element also requires the County to use focused EIRs 

        in RCA overlay areas, and specifically suggests that mitigation measures 

        should be based on actual, on-site review of resource significance. Id. 

        at X-14. In direct contravention of these requirements, the EIR indicates 

        that lands would be cleared to &quot;facilitate agricultural uses&quot; 

        with no further environmental review.</p>

      <p>Finally, the Conservation Element suggests that consideration be given 

        to zoning with the express purpose of protecting RCA overlay areas. Id. 

        at X- 14. Far from complying with this General Plan provision, the County 

        currently proposes to redesignate and rezone lands to &quot;facilitate 

        agriculture,&quot; despite the knowledge that these proposed land use 

        changes could result in the elimination of sensitive habitats on those 

        (20) lands that are subject to RCA overlay requirements.</p>

      <p>In sum, the County's proposed project, if approved, would directly contravene 

        the Conservation Element's protective provisions relating to vegetation 

        and wildlife and especially the requirements relating to the RCA overlay. 

        To ensure consistency with the General Plan, the County must consider 

        adopting such measures as public acquisition, the establishment of open 

        space easements, and the application of special land use controls. Effective 

        land use controls would include measures such as</p>

      <p>cluster zoning, large lot zoning, and natural resource preservation overlay 

        zones within the proposed project.</p>

      <p><strong>IV. CONCLUSION</strong></p>

      <p>For the foregoing reasons, Save Our Forest and Ranchlands and the California 

        Oak Foundation urge the County to delay further consideration of the proposed 

        project until (1) a revised draft EIR is prepared and recirculated to 

        fully comply with CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, and (2) the project is 

        redesigned in a manner consistent with the San Diego County General Plan.</p>
