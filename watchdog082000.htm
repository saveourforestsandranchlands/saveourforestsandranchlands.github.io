      <blockquote>The Cleveland National Forest was defended by the Descanso Planning 

        Group on 17 August 2000 when the Group voted unanimously to recommend 

        that the County of San Diego Department of Planning &amp; Land Use deny 

        the Stallion Oaks project. This massive proposed project would cut and 

        fill over 42,000 cubic yards of material to construct 125 cabins and a 

        70,000 square foot mega-spa/resort in the oak woodlands just northwest 

        of Descanso within the Cleveland National Forest. The Descanso Planning 

        Group also voted unanimously to reject the Specific Plan as inconsistent 

        with the County's General Plan, to find the Environmental Impact Report 

        inadequate, and the proposed project as not meeting any of the findings 

        required of a Major Use Permit under the County's Zoning Ordinance Section 

        7358. Congratulations to the Descanso Planning Group for protecting the 

        Cleveland National Forest and the country town of Descanso!</blockquote>

      <blockquote>The Pechanga Fire burned 11,734 acres on the northwest slopes 

        of Palomar Mountain from July 28-August 10, 2000. An integrated USDA Forest 

        Service and California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection incident 

        command team led the suppression efforts, with more than 1700 firefighters 

        committed at the peak of the fire. Smoke was visible several afternoons 

        from North County San Diego. Several people have asked about the fire 

        history and vegetation on the mountain, the use of dozers to open former 

        firelines in the wilderness, and about protection of special resources.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>You are cordially invited to an informal discussion about BIODIVERSITY
