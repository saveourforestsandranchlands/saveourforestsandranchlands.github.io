    <TD> <p><strong>TransNet </strong></p>

      <p>According to a California Public Policy Institute poll conducted June 

        2000, traffic is the No. 1 concern among San Diegans. </p>

      <p>In 1987, San Diego County voters passed a half-cent sales tax to fund 

        transportation improvements. The TransNet tax provides the biggest pot 

        of locally generated money for transportation projects. The current transportation 

        tax expires in 2008. It currently is used to support construction bonds, 

        so that important projects don't have to wait until the cash from the 

        tax is available in order to begin. If you look at a list of current projects 

        paid in part by TransNet funds, it becomes clear how important this revenue 

        is: State Route 56, the Interstates 5 and 805 merge, State Route 52, State 

        Route 125, Mission Valley East Trolley line, new trolley and Coaster stations, 

        hundreds of buses and the expansion of dozens of major arterial roads 

        from Carlsbad to Chula Vista. That half-cent builds the roads, freeways 

        and transit that we all use every day. </p>

      <p>Last July, an item concerning placing an extension of the TransNet tax 

        on the November 2000 ballot was hastily brought before San Diego&#8217;s 

        regional transportation planning agency, SANDAG. (Any extension of transportation 

        taxes requires a two-thirds majority vote of the citizens.)The proposal 

        brought before the Board of SANDAG was not for a simple extension of the 

        half-cent tax, however. Inconceivably, proponents planned to redistribute 

        TransNet revenues away from transportation projects to pay for habitat 

        preservation and water conservation and clean-up projects, including the 

        scientifically-unsupported Multiple Species Conservation Plan. </p>

      <p>Last year&#8217;s proponents of the TransNet extension pointed to a poll 

        commissioned by The Nature Conservancy, which showed 67% of voters would 

        support extending the tax to pay for $7 billion in transportation improvements 

        and environmental protection (margin of error at +/- 4.4%). Proponents 

        were extremely reticent about providing polling results to be reviewed 

        by the Board so that they could review survey questions and methodology. 

      </p>

      <p>TransNet&#8217;s half-cent tax was always intended for transportation. 

        Currently, TransNet revenues are exclusively used for transportation projects 

        and divided evenly three ways: transit projects, highways and local streets. 

      </p>

      <p>Under the new proposal, transportation would have only received 70 percent 

        of TransNet funds, which would then be carved up in four parts: 25 percent 

        each for highways, transit, local streets and the board's &quot;discretion.&quot; 

        The measure guaranteed that the transportation projects got at least 17.5 

        percent each of the tax revenues and any could collect up to 35 percent. 

        When you do the math, this translates into a decrease in funding for transportation 

        projects <strong>by half</strong>. </p>

      <p>After hours of public testimony and debate among the Board members on 

        the appropriateness of rushing through such a hastily designed measure, 

        SANDAG&#8217;s Board unanimously voted against placing the tax extension, 

        as proposed, on the November ballot saying the timing was wrong, the spending 

        plan lacked a clear plan for easing traffic congestion, and there was 

        too much opposition. </p>

      <p>On Sunday, April 1st, Supervisor Slater proposed once again placing TransNet 

        on the November ballot to fund improvements for our County&#8217;s transportation 

        system. While the bulk of her article was devoted to advocating a new 

        Flex-Trolley system for the County (a classier stage name for proverbial 

        busses), she conveniently omitted any discussion of her drive last year 

        to carve up TransNet to pay for the fraudulent developer-led habitat mitigation 

        program, the MSCP. </p>

      <p>However, at the beginning of her editorial, she did note her meetings 

        with other proponents of last year&#8217;s failed TransNet debacle. It 

        should be pointed out that two of those participants at her meeting, the 

        Alliance for Habitat Conservation and Endangered Habitats League, are 

        negotiators for the real estate and development industries who stand to 

        win big if TransNet is approved for funding open space acquisition. </p>

      <p>Using TransNet monies to facilitate sprawl development in the name of 

        the MSCP not only further corrupts a plan with its own designated funding 

        source, it diverts attention away from what is indisputably the leading 

        cause of our region&#8217;s transit problems, the unwillingness of our 

        county&#8217;s elected leaders to deal responsibly and effectively with 

        growth.</p>

      <p>It has been noted that solutions to our region&#8217;s transportation 

        problems are hard to implement because growth in San Diego County has 

        fed sprawl and sprawl makes it difficult to provide mass transit. Exactly. 

        But if sprawl is the problem, why do the supervisors champion trolleys 

        over urban growth boundaries? Urban growth boundaries contain growth patterns 

        so that transit systems can be viable, open space protected, and needed 

        investments directed to existing urban areas. A Public Policy Institute 

        poll of San Diego citizens in June 2000 found 67% support urban growth 

        boundaries to contain sprawl.</p>

      <p>How can our land-use custodians, the Board of Supervisors, pretend to 

        be opponents of sprawl when it&#8217;s precisely their own land-use decisions 

        that have created the problem? Supervisor Slater, along with her colleagues, 

        voted for GPA 96-03, the general plan amendment that would destroy San 

        Diego&#8217;s backcountry. She fought against the Rural Heritage and Watershed 

        Initiative, which is the only legitimate plan to protect the backcountry 

        from sprawl development. And she joined her colleagues in approving the 

        4S Ranch development, which the project&#8217;s Environmental Impact Report 

        estimates will create waits on metered I-15 onramps and residential streets 

        in Rancho Bernardo of up to and over an hour.</p>

      <p> As our region&#8217;s water, infrastructure, open space, traffic, and 

        energy crises bear down on San Diego County residents like five horsemen 

        of the Apocalypse, San Diego&#8217;s Board of Supervisors can no longer 

        hide behind smart growth conferences, clean water conferences, or new 

        mass transit proposals to avoid responsibility for the present critical 

        state of our county&#8217;s economic and environmental health. The &#8220;bold 

        action&#8221; called for by supervisor Slater must be a challenge taken 

        up by the supervisors themselves in establishing economically and environmentally 

        sound land-use criteria that preserve what&#8217;s left of our county&#8217;s 

        natural resources and prevent the further contamination of our waterways 

        and beaches.</p>

      <p> The County Supervisors should abandon its planning models based on population 

        density and concentrate on drawing urban growth boundaries so that long-term 

        investments in public transit, open space, and desperately needed infrastructure 

        for our urban areas can truly serve our present and future generations.</p>

      <p>Without sustainable public policies that value the natural and man-made 

        resources we have left, our region could become a wasteland as tragically 

        beyond hope as anything in Los Angeles. If that&#8217;s what the supervisors 

        have in mind for San Diego County, shame on them.</p>

      <p>This issue is expected to come before SANDAG again sometime this summer.<br>
