    <TD> <p><strong>SAVE THE FOREST</strong></p>

      <p>The Third CNFF Celebration<br>

        Honoring Theodore Roosevelt&#8217;s 142nd Birthday<br>

        And His Enduring Vision for Our Forest</p>

      <p>On October 27, 1858, one of America&#8217;s greatest environmentalists 

        was born: </p>

      <p>President Theodore Roosevelt.<br>

        His leadership and vision resulted in a stunning gift to future generations:<br>

        The Cleveland National Forest.</p>

      <p>By setting aside 2,000.000 acres of magnificent wilderness from Mt. San 

        Jacinto to the Mexican border, the beauty of open space, trees, surrounding 

        vegetation and all the wildlife it sustains was to be ours forever. Unfortunately, 

        we have this irreplaceable heritage to decline to 650,000 acres.</p>

      <p>The Cleveland National Forest Foundation was created for the sole purpose 

        of protecting what remains of his gift. We ask that you join in this momentous 

        endeavor.</p>

      <p>Celebrate with us the Foundation&#8217;s success in acquiring Ellis Ranch 

        and donating this priceless entrance to the Cleveland National Forest 

        and gateway to Cuyamuca Rancho State Park to the United States Forest 

        Service. And join with us for the launching of CNFF&#8217;s Conservation 

        Easement Program to protect wildlands and watershed in the Forest.</p>
