      <p> Professor of Communications, UCSD. Originally published in the Anderson 

      </p>

      <p>Valley Advertiser (Boonville, Mendocino County), a famous &quot;green&quot; 

        paper:</p>

      <p>The land war in Southern California reaches back at least to the early 

        1990s. In those years, the big developers -- Pardee, Bren Home, McMillan, 

        Standard American, and the Irvine Land Company were building sprawling 

        new cities on what was left of the delicate canyons, mesas and wetlands 

        of California's coast. Pushing back, some tiny environmental groups fought 

        the real estate octopus with legal challenges, protest, and endangered 

        species listings. Southern California was, and remains, a hot spot of 

        environmental destruction. Enter the California gnatcatcher, denizen of 

        coastal sage scrub, emblem of scores of threatened and endangered animals 

        and plants. The developers screamed that the bird could not be allowed 

        to hold up the pace of coastal decimation. Something had to give. The 

        Endangered Species Act had to go.</p>

      <p>The developers' Sacramento and Washington friends told them otherwise: 

        wildlife is politically popular. It was going to take a village --- a 

        Potemkin Village. For the public, the impression had to be created that 

        the damaged environment was being protected and restored, while in the 

        boardrooms, the land developers and lumber companies needed to remain 

        confident of their expanding profits. A new practice of environmentalism 

        had to take shape, one that would be guided by &quot;collaboration and 

        cooperation,&quot; rather than confrontation and lawsuit. A new class 

        of guides, enviro-fixers and brokers emerged, lushly funded by the same 

        corporations that filled Pete Wilson, George Bush and Bill Clinton's coffers.</p>

      <p><strong>With love, from Pete and Bruce</strong></p>

      <p>In California, the Potemkin village is called the Natural Communities 

        Conservation Planning Initiative. Dreamt up by Pete Wilson and Bruce Babbit, 

        in essence it allows developers to &quot;take&quot; (destroy) endangered 

        species and their terrain, if they promise to somehow &quot;mitigate&quot; 

        the destruction. The initiative allows for giant-sized Habitat Conservation 

        Plans, a kind of exemption for private landholders allowed under section 

        10 of the Endangered Species Act. In each Southern California county, 

        a board of governments, planning authorities, developers, and representatives 

        of state and federal agencies, including the Fish and Wildlife Service 

        and the State Department of Fish and Game, is supposed to design a system 

        of linked preserves. These set aside lands are supposed to provide permanent 

        and viable homelands for threatened birds, plants and animals. Cagily, 

        Wilson and Babbit took a page from the book of the best conservation biologists, 

        who'd long ago understood that large, whole, working environments are 

        needed for species to recover. The gnatcatcher, the arroyo toad, the quino 

        checkerspot butterfly, and many more, would all be saved, Bruce Babbitt 

        claimed when he announced the plan, because developers would do the right 

        thing if they were given the right incentives and not backed in to a corner 

        by environmental regulations.</p>

      <p>They were given incentives. Natural communities planning allows developers 

        to &quot;take&quot; species by cutting deals, often remarkably crude ones. 

        They can </p>

      <p>swap or sell land into a habitat preserve in return for the right to 

        develop on or next to sensitive land. In practice, the swapped land doesn't 

        have to be of prime quality -- it can be undesirable or left-over. It 

        need not be the most critical parcel to the endangered species. In some 

        cases, for example, in Orange County, builders have been able to use lands 

        already owned by the public as &quot;reserves&quot; against their takings. 

        In others, they have been able to count land they had already designated 

        as open space as &quot;mitigation.&quot; Double-dipping, as we call it. 

        Developers can build concrete culverts as connecting wildlife corridors, 

        or simply label an asphalt highway as a path for animals' movements. Most 

        important, special protections are built in for the land speculators: 

        after a development has been approved, no further legal environmental 

        limits can be placed it for fifty years in San Diego County --- longer 

        in the Riverside and Orange County versions of the plan. This &quot;no 

        surprises&quot; clause means that no matter what happens to a species, 

        a watershed, or in the world of science, nothing will interfere with the 

        owner's ability to profit from that piece of land. But nature is one big 

        surprise, and in Southern California's badly depleted, overbuilt landscapes, 

        natural communities planning is proving to be one big mess. </p>

      <p><strong>A place at the table</strong></p>

      <p> The Wilson-Babbit plan offered the building industry and real estate 

        speculators opportunities to bend environmental regulation on an unprecedented 

        scale because it gave them an official and recognized &quot;place at the 

        table.&quot; Along with carefully selected moderate environmental organizations, 

        they were &quot;stake holders&quot; as the giant habitat plans were pieced 

        out. Before, they had wheeled and dealt out of the public eye, in Washington 

        and smaller Babylons. Now, they told Fish and Wildlife, cities, counties 

        and environmentalists which land would be preserved and written off as 

        a tax deduction, and which would be developed. And they got to advertise 

        these wonderful &quot;wildlands&quot; adjacent to their sprawling new 

        cities. (The Irvine Company's web page provides particularly nauseating 

        examples.)</p>

      <p>Many of Washington's big green organizations were generally enthusiastic. 

        This was no shocker. As Alexander Cockburn, Ken Silverstein and Jeffrey 

        St. Clair have written, the national environmental organizations have 

        been marinating in swamps of corporate money for years. And these biggies 

        -- notably The Nature Conservancy -- played a very important role in giving 

        habitat planning good cover. Not incidentally, The Nature Conservancy 

        has an enormous financial interest in the various plans going forward, 

        since it is active in acquiring and managing much of the swapped habitat, 

        notably in Orange County. As the wise use movement gurus Ron Arnold and 

        Alan Gottleib point out in &quot;Trashing the Environment,&quot; The Conservancy 

        is an incredibly wealthy real estate firm in its own right, profits from 

        its land deals with the government, and often works by devious means. 

        (Arnold and Gottleib are anti-environmentalist to the point of being nutty, 

        but they have done solid research on The Nature Conservancy that all environmentalists 

        should read.)</p>

      <p>So there was little public criticism from the influential national organizations. 

        Article after article celebrating the wonders of working together and 

        an end to the &quot;stalemates&quot; in California issued from the magazines 

        and fund raising mailings of the big greenies. Not that all the environmentalists 

        were compliant. Michael Soule, an eminent biologist and one of the first 

        to argue that species recovery depends on huge, linked habitat preserves, 

        called the NCCP initiative a science-free fraud. Earth Firsters, a few 

        small Southern California groups, and property rights activists complained 

        publicly.</p>

      <p>Another effect of the Wilson-Babbit plan was to create a new layer of 

        deal makers, precisely because the process required often hostile forces 

        to &quot;collaborate&quot; in a weird harmonization. Small landowners 

        were sometimes recalcitrant, fearing they might be forced to sell their 

        property into a preserve at below market prices. (If they had any experience 

        with The Nature Conservancy, they were right to be worried.) Large landowners 

        wanted the best deal. There were dozens of local conservation groups; 

        some, like Save Our Forests and Ranchlands and Spirit of the Sage Council, 

        got suspicious when they took a look at whether the preserves would really 

        let rare and wild places thrive. Conservation biologists and professional 

        ecologists were hostile because they knew the plan put horse-trading before 

        science, and as practicing field scientists they were aware of how tentative 

        and inadequate their own predictions about restoration, survival, and 

        recovery really are. All these people had to be convinced that the Natural 

        Communities Conservation Planning initiative was the best hope for the 

        more than eighty threatened and endangered plants and animals in Southern 

        California. If they could not be convinced, these folks had to be silenced, 

        marginalized and pushed away from the negotiating table.</p>

      <p>Meantime, U. S. Fish and Wildlife held meetings for its own employees, 

        putting pressure on them to learn the &quot;new way of doing business,&quot; 

        including &quot;thinking about consensus&quot; around ecosystems rather 

        than listing species. Knowledgeable Fish and Wildlife scientists and other 

        employees were silenced. Jobs were at stake; for some independent scientists, 

        contracts were at stake. Some university biologists who objected to the 

        plans were eased off the review panels.</p>

      <p><strong>There was a wicked messenger</strong></p>

      <p> So the gates opened for the wicked messengers, the people who would 

        devote themselves to helping the deals sound good in the press, look good 

        on paper, </p>

      <p>reflect glory on the elected officials and contain the grassroots greens. 

        It was most important that these water carriers and the go-betweens appear 

        not only green but local. U. S. Fish and Wildlife could not appear to 

        be telling property owners what they could and couldn't do with their 

        land, and at the same time, it was also important for the political process 

        that the big developers not seem to be running the show, although that 

        veneer was and remains impossibly thin. Wilson and Babbit had prepared 

        the ground for a new, noxious species, a tangle of fake greenery in the 

        form of conservation &quot;leagues,&quot; &quot;alliances&quot; and &quot;coalitions&quot;.</p>

      <p>I'm sure such green false-fronts exist all over the state, and for that 

        matter, all over the nation. But because the California initiative, and 

        especially San Diego County's Multiple Species Conservation Plan variants, 

        are the biggest test runs around the Endangered Species Act, the plastic 

        greens have had a particularly pernicious effect here. By calling themselves 

        the leaders, they have given the endorsement of so-called &quot;local 

        environmentalists&quot; to pathetic compromises. In some cases they have 

        actively supported horrendous new projects. They have called out critics 

        as divisive and irrational, and helped the press label committed grassroots 

        activists extremists. Perhaps worst of all, they have helped squander 

        a decade and hundreds of millions of dollars on plans that will probably 

        fail to achieve species recovery.</p>

      <p>Though by no means unique, the Endangered Habitats League is the paradigmatic 

        example of green vinyl in the Southland. The League emerged in 1991 from 

        an Audobon Society/Natural Resources Defense Council effort to list the 

        California gnatcatcher. After the listing, and with funding from the World 

        Wildlife Fund and the Audobon Society, Endangered Habitats went on to 

        be a key representative of environmental groups in the multi-county NCCP 

        process. But activists who participated in early meetings say it was never 

        quite clear who had the mandate to elect the League's director, Dr. Dan 

        Silver, M.D., to take the reins, nor are they quite sure how he's kept 

        his leading role brokering land swaps, purchases, mitigation, and donations 

        in Orange County, Riverside and San Diego Counties. Silver and the San 

        Diego director, Michael Beck, have close ties to The Nature Conservancy 

        and to the Big Greens. They receive environmental awards of doubtful merit, 

        and bestow similar honors on politicians with dicey environmental voting 

        records, especially in election years. (Actually, most San Diego politicians 

        have terrible environmental voting records overall.) In San Diego County, 

        where a knock-down, drag-out war over back country zoning is being fought 

        as I write, the League is in tight with the private Building Industry 

        Association, as well as the Mayor's office and the County Board of Supervisors, 

        notoriously pro-development and ethically challenged public bodies. Silver, 

        Beck and their friends are carrying water for Southern California's biggest 

        developers and calling it nature-saving.</p>

      <p><strong>The front</strong></p>

      <p> Dan Silver claims that The Endangered Habitats League is a grassroots 

        membership organization. This conflicts sharply with the way it is regularly 

        and approvingly described in the press, variously as an &quot;environmental 

        coalition,&quot; a green &quot;consortium,&quot; &quot;an alliance&quot; 

        or &quot;representing an alliance of environmental groups.&quot; Silver 

        says the League has about 400 members, mostly individuals, and a few grassroots 

        organizations. &quot;But we do not represent the organizations.&quot; 

        When I point this contradiction out to him, he says &quot;The press has 

        it wrong.&quot; Who is in charge of describing an organization to the 

        press, if not the director? Can I see his list of member organizations? 

        &quot;Sorry, I'm too busy. I don't have a secretary.&quot;</p>

      <p>The League has an office on Santa Monica Boulevard in Los Angeles, but 

        no office or phone-book listing in San Diego. Linked to dozens of of enviro 

        webpages, the League has no website of its own, and offers no detailed 

        public information about the organization's makeup, policies or if and 

        how one can join. It has posted some old newsletters on the web at http//www.exo/~dsilver/. 

        Although Silver says they do, none of the newsletters I've read announce 

        regular or occasional local meetings. They do announce an annual meeting. 

        Nor do the newsletters solicit concrete participation, but in sluggish 

        prose, they say things along the line of &quot;we are making slow but 

        steady progress and we'll keep you posted.&quot; A search of the exhaustive 

        CD-ROM data base for the San Diego Union-Tribune turned up no public meeting 

        announcements between the League's founding year, 1991, and 2000. But 

        it did turn up plenty of articles-- scores -- where either Dr. Silver 

        or Mr. Beck is described as representing &quot;the environmental community&quot; 

        and saying &quot;It's a sound plan for the environment&quot; about one 

        land deal or another.</p>

      <p>The Endangered Habitats League is a registered 501C(3), that is, a non-profit 

        charitable organization, and according to the papers and IRS forms it 

        submits to the California Secretary of State and the State Registry of 

        Charitable Trusts, it has had the same board of six directors since it 

        incorporated in 1993. These six are reelected every two years. Beck and 

        Silver are the two salaried and active members, and the treasurer is paid 

        for doing the books. Donations to the League are fifty per cent tax-deductible.</p>

      <p>When I phoned Dan Silver to ask if he could send me a copy of the League's 

        annual reports, press packets, and old newsletters, he was reluctant, 

        saying they didn't really have any reports or press packets, but he would 

        try to send me a few recent newsletters. Too much trouble to dig up that 

        stuff. It's a small office, he explained, no staff, no xerox machine. 

        I think it is illegal for a 501c(3) to deny a member of the public access 

        to the annual report. But I didn't push it. I called Attorney General 

        Bill Lockyer's office for their tax returns.</p>

      <p>This is the United States, and anybody who wants to form an organization 

        for any purpose can form one. You can call your outfit whatever you want. 

        If you want to form a tax-exempt foundation to expand public understanding 

        of why the little grey men set their spaceships down in Wyoming and definitely 

        not in New Mexico, you are by law allowed to. But you have to file papers 

        of incorporation, and you have to report your purpose, your activities, 

        and in a vague sort of way, how you spend your money. In their filings 

        and newsletters, the League states that it is devoted to &quot;community 

        outreach&quot; furthering the success of the Natural Communities Conservation 

        Planning process. Its main purpose is &quot;protection for natural habitats 

        through collaborative conflict resolution. &quot; This means touting and 

        furthering the Wilson Babbit end run around the Endangered Species Act. 

        Let's pause to consider the paradox of that last phrase &quot;collaborative 

        conflict resolution.&quot; In Southern California, the land itself is 

        at the center of intense political conflict. The prerogatives of the big 

        developers have hit the wall of public sentiment in favor of the environment. 

        There's no getting around it. So the question becomes: who has to collaborate 

        and resolve conflict with whom, and on what terms? You can't ride two 

        horses with one behind.</p>

      <p><strong>Through a glass darkly</strong></p>

      <p> Looking at the League's 990 forms is intriguing and mystifying. Despite 

        its grassroots membership front, Endangered Habitats League tax forms 

        (IRS 990) reveal that after a slow start in the early 1990s, it has had 

        plenty of money, certainly much more than some of the tiny organizations 

        battling for the enforcement of the Endangered Species Act. In 1998, the 

        Endangered Habitats League received $183,000 in &quot;contributions&quot; 

        &quot;from public sources,&quot; that is, private donations and foundation 

        grants. Most of this went to salaries and a lumped category called &quot;program 

        services&quot;. Mr. Beck and Dr. Silver pay themselves about $26,000 a 

        year each, not much of a salary in pricey Southern California. The League 

        doesn't give any grants, or scholarships nor pay benefits to anyone. It 

        says it doesn't share facilities, resources or money or staff with any 

        other organizations. It doesn't pay retirement, assess or collect membership 

        dues; it has hired the occasional consultant, but didn't in 1998. It spent 

        small amounts on legal fees ($15,000) and on a grant writer ($6,000). 

        Beck and Silver attend conferences and they talk on the phone a lot. Their 

        phone bill for 1998 was just under $7,000. Reporter and editor Jeff St. 

        Clair's phone bill is about $2,000.00 a year. &quot;They must have a phone 

        fetish,&quot; says Jeff.</p>

      <p>Tellingly, the League says it doesn't hire lobbyists. But this obscures 

        the fact that by any reasonable definition of the term, they are lobbyists 

        --- they fly around to meetings a lot, probably in Washington and Sacramento; 

        they pop off to visit with Bruce Babbit himself; they meet in closed sessions 

        in San Diego with agency officials and elected officials. And, in their 

        role as Endangered Habitats League leaders, they endorse candidates for 

        political office. Most recently, Dan Silver endorsed Ron Roberts, head 

        of the San Diego Board of Supervisors who is running for mayor. This is 

        illegal for a 501(C) 3.</p>

      <p>Back to the cash box. In addition to grants of cash and securities, the 

        EHL received more than $274,000 in donated services, equipment or facilities, 

        pushing their total revenues up past $450,000 for '98. The League did 

        not report just what this donation consisted of. Could it be an office? 

        An airplane? Real estate? Cars? They really don&#8217;t have a xerox machine? 

        Someone is taking a big, big tax deduction.</p>

      <p>The Attorney General does not reveal the names of donors and contributors 

        on the IRS 990. These are blacked out, just like in an FBI file. So now 

        we turn to the Foundation Center's data bases on grants and giving. Hefty 

        and repeated grants have come over the League's transom in the last five 

        years from the James Irvine Foundation and the Hewlett Foundation. At 

        minimum, EHL pulled down $50,000 in 1997 from Hewlett, along with $22,500 

        from the Homeland Foundation; in 1998, it received $150,000 from Hewlett, 

        to be spread over three years, and $100,000 from Irvine, to be spread 

        over two years; in 2000, Irvine gave the League another $150,000 to tide 

        them over through 2001. Between those two major foundations alone, Endangered 

        Habitats League was supported to the tune of nearly $100,000 per year 

        over the last four years. There are smaller grants from other foundations 

        and organizations, and doubtless from individual donors. But $100k a year 

        is a lot of simoleans.</p>

      <p>None of the League's newsletters I slogged through announce these enormous 

        grants to the membership or the public. Why not? Setting that question 

        aside for the moment, here's another. What's wrong with using big grants 

        to support an environmental &quot;membership group&quot;? Can't big grant 

        money be used to do good things? First off, this money isn't clean if 

        you know anything about the politics of the donors. The James Irvine Foundation 

        derives directly from the Irvine Company's nearly endless Orange County 

        real estate developments, office building projects, and Real Estate Investment 

        Trusts (REITS, a form of stock market mutual fund for real estate speculators). 

        The company took in more than a billion dollars in profits in 1998. Irvine 

        is the company that benefitted the most from the Orange County NCCP, a 

        plan which The Nature Conservancy brokered and Endangered Habitats publicly 

        supported (representing the environmental community, of course). In 1996, 

        to Irvine president Donald Bren's great satisfaction, the plan went through 

        allowing Irvine to construct high-tech industry parks, roads, new towns 

        housing tens of thousands of people, and fancy resorts in the middle of 

        gnatcatcher territory. At the time, Silver told the press that this showed 

        the effectiveness of the Endangered Species Act! A bit more than a year 

        later, Irvine Foundation money makes its way to the Endangered Habitats 

        League, doubtless with a note saying &quot;Keep up the good work. &quot;</p>

      <p>The 85.4 million dollars the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation dispensed 

        in 1998 came directly from the computer and electronics fortune. The Hewlett 

        and Packard families own extensive western cattle ranches, among other 

        wealth; The Hewletts and their Foundation are notorious for opposing reform 

        of federal timber and grazing policies, and this reactionary position 

        is unpopular with the most timid of closet enviros. Here we have at least 

        one reason why the Endangered Habitats League doesn't announce any of 

        its big grants, at least from Hewlett.</p>

      <p>Can you do good things with bad money? As I've already pointed out, the 

        NCCP initiative for which Endangered Habitats League has labored loyally 

        is not a good thing in general, in particular, nor in its local variations. 

        Dan Silver disagrees: &quot;It really depends on whether you think the 

        glass is half empty or half full.&quot; The glass may be more than half 

        empty. Not only do the habitat plans let developers trash the environment, 

        but in actual fact, there's little money for new land acquisition to make 

        the preserves. </p>

      <p>To the extent that the plans do set aside land for endangered species, 

        there is no funding or provision for monitoring species recovery. What 

        strapped government agency wants to monitor downward trends after it's 

        been implicated for years in all the glowing p.r.? Nor is there money 

        for habitat management, in the form of fire or weed removal, for example. 

        Plant biologist Ellen Bauder says that &quot;the Sweetwater Fish and Wildlife 

        Service Refuge [part of the San Diego plan] is solid weeds, some of them 

        noxious, a legal status. It would take many millions of dollars and decades 

        to improve this weed-infested, over-grazed preserve land&quot; so rare 

        plants could recover. There's no money for control of access, and in many 

        areas, the distinction between open space, where you can ride your horse, 

        your jeep or your ATV, and a wildlife preserve, which demands minimum 

        impacts, is non-existent. In fact, this distinction is purposefully blurred 

        in the public's mind when politicians talk about habitat plans -- they 

        usually talk in terms of the benefits of open space. There's no control 

        at all of some reserves: The City of San Diego, which passed its own plan 

        in 1998, has been completely negligent in protecting its own rare vernal 

        pools, for example. After setting them aside, it's been issuing developers 

        permits to bulldoze them! Then, again, there's the &quot;no surprises&quot; 

        clause. So, no, the NCCP as it has worked out is not a good thing for 

        a so-called grassroots membership group to spend bad money working toward. 

        Many honest and broke grassroots organizations are fighting the plans 

        in the courts. Silver won't join, saying &quot;I just don't understand 

        their rationale.&quot;</p>

      <p><strong>Charity begins and ends at home</strong></p>

      <p> The reason he doesn't is probably Irvine and Hewlett and their endless 

        money. Both foundations are profoundly interested in shaping environmental 

        policy in the West, and Silver clearly wants to be aboard the policy making 

        train. Irvine, for transparent reasons, has a special focus on the Southland. 

        Charity begins at home and the foundations watch out for the interests 

        of the parent companies and kindred corporations, trying to shape environmental 

        and land use law in ways that will not limit their profits. Lots of things 

        could put a crimp in corporate real estate's style: stringent local zoning, 

        strict enforcement of state and federal environmental regulations, sane 

        housing and transportation policies, intense grassroots activism. But 

        the biggest cramp of all was and maybe still is the federal Endangered 

        Species Act.</p>

      <p>It's useful to read the foundations' &quot;granting priorities.&quot; 

        For example, Irvine's include &quot;smart growth and livable communities.&quot; 

        Sounds good, but does that mean more Irvines? The Foundation &quot;works 

        with a network of regional, statewide and national organizations dedicated 

        to achieving more sustainable use of the land, across all of California's 

        varied landscapes.&quot; In other words, there's a land use crisis in 

        Southern California which the Irvine Company helped cause. Having noticed 

        the public outrage at the disaster, the Irvine Foundation now gives money 

        to groups that will help guide public opinion toward some superficial 

        controls on California's out of control development, with the hopes of 

        reining in the citizen initiatives and lawsuits that have driven developers 

        from L.A. to Tijuana crazy.</p>

      <p>Irvine has given millions upon millions to engineer the public understanding 

        of environmental issues. For example, in 1999, Irvine gave $4,750,000 

        grants for &quot;sustainable land use&quot; projects and education. But 

        listen to the sound of public opinion being sculpted: The Foundation supports 

        &quot;regional leadership&quot; &quot;community visioning workshops&quot; 

        &quot;community strategy work teams,&quot; plans to &quot;strengthen civic 

        capacity&quot; around environmental issues. They also aim to improve &quot;public 

        understanding by improving environmental reporting,&quot; &quot;by &quot;engaging 

        leaders in dialogue&quot; and &quot;supporting coalition building.&quot; 

      </p>

      <p>The overall picture is this: The Irvine Company, through the Irvine Foundation, 

        is penetrating the public discussion of the environmental crisis at many 

        different points. Big grants from a real estate company to train journalists 

        who cover the environment? It should give us the chills.</p>

      <p>What about The Hewlett's Foundation's charitable priorities? Hewlett 

        recognizes that &quot;natural resource limits are well in sight&quot; 

        in the West. The Foundation &quot;supports constructive change in environmental 

        policy,&quot; and its objective is to &quot;seek out and support organizations 

        capable of effectively promoting a change to sustainable policies ..&#8230;. 

        to enrich the array of policy options to achieve the changes necessary.&quot; 

        A special goal is to &quot;encourage methods other than litigation and 

        political advocacy for environmental solutions.&quot; Anyone for collaborative 

        conflict resolution?</p>

      <p>Hewlett spreads a lot of money around, even to some good outfits like 

        Island Press. But finally, Hewlett's programs focus on groups that have 

        a larger than local focus. They are not interested in small communities, 

        &quot;single issues&quot; or single watershed projects. They give grants 

        to groups that work across large regions and bridge ecosystem boundaries. 

        Sounds good, but it is precisely the long-haul, local environmentalists 

        who know the most, scientifically and historically, about the crisis of 

        their ecosystem. </p>

      <p>Wisdom sits in places. People tied to places tend to care the most and 

        fight the hardest for those places. They tend to get called uncompromising 

        radicals. But even temperate grassroots greens won't get any money from 

        the Hewlett Foundation unless they come into the conflict-avoidant &quot;consortium.&quot; 

        That would be the Endangered Habitats League or one of their hundreds 

        of cousins.</p>

      <p>In a second installment, I'll detail some of the Endangered Habitats 

        League's activities in San Diego County, and show why they've come into 

        conflict (naughty word) with some of that area's least daunted environmentalists. 

        And how is natural communities conservation planning doing in San Diego? 

        And what have Hewlett and Irvine gotten for their money? (Hints: a) not 

        very well b) something, but not as much as they'd hoped.)</p>
