  	<TD><P><font size=2><u><b>PUBLIC RECORDS ACT LAWSUIT</b></u></font></p>

      <blockquote>The RHWI Committee initiated the Public Records Act 

        Lawsuit after the County failed to produce documents that would provide 

        evidence of the County's illegal electioneering effort to thwart 

        RHWI, an important citizen's initiative. Prior to the election, evidence 

        kept surfacing that public officials were doing everything in their power 

        to undermine the initiative process. Indeed, the Gogek article, published 

        in the San Diego Union-Tribune, revealed the precise nature and parties 

        involved in the illegal campaign activity.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>Finally, after much legal wrangling, a hearing to 

        decide whether or not documents would be turned over has been changed 

        to a trial set for October 22, 1999. In preparation for the trial, a privilege 

        log describing the authors and circumstances of the documents in question 

        was given to RHWI lawyers. The privilege log, without a doubt, has confirmed 

        our suspicions that there was collusion among high-ranking public officials 

        with respect to the formation of the so-called County study of RHWI and 

        its presentation to the Board of Supervisors. The privilege log refers 

        to handwritten notes made by Gary Pryor, Director of the Department of 

        Planning and Land Use, while talking to Larry Prior, the County's 

        Chief Administrative Officer, regarding investigations into leaks regarding 

        the presentation of the RHWI report to the Board. </blockquote>
