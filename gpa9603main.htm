    <TD> <p>For the third time, SOFAR was victorious in its battle against the 

        County for its inadequate planning for our almost 200,000 acres of precious 

        backcountry rangelands and wildlands. Judge Judith McConnell of the Superior 

        Court issued an order directing the County and the Board of Supervisors 

        to vacate their approval of General Plan Amendment 96-03, certification 

        of the EIR for the project, and approval of the CEQA Findings Concerning 

        Mitigation of Significant Effects of the Project and the Statement of 

        Overriding Consideration.</p>

      <p>Further, the court directs the County to certify an EIR that complies 

        with CEQA and rectifies the inadequacies specified in the court's Statement 

        of Decision from August 31, 2000. This order was stipulated by both SOFAR 

        and the County.</p>

      <p>As expected, the County appealed the Court's decision. The Appeal's Court 

        was scheduled to hear the case in March 2001 but it has been extended 

        until late summer.</p>

        <a href="history.htm">SOFAR's effort</a>s have always centered on preventing 

        inappropriate development from encroaching on San Diego's backcountry. 

        See <a href="background.htm">Background</a>. Once again last November, 

        the Court decided in favor of SOFAR&#8217;s case against the County for 

        the County&#8217;s inadequate planning for almost 200,000 acres of precious 

        backcountry rangelands and wildlands. Judge Judith McConnell of the Superior 

        Court issued an order directing the County and the Board of Supervisors 

        to vacate their approval of General Plan Amendment (GPA) 96-03, certification 

        of the EIR for the project, and approval of the CEQA Findings Concerning 

        Mitigation of Significant Effects of the Project and the Statement of 

        Overriding Consideration. Further, the court directs the County to certify 

        an EIR that complies with CEQA and rectifies the inadequacies specified 

        in the court&#8217;s Statement of Decision from August 31, 2000. This 

        order was stipulated by both SOFAR and the County. Currently, the case 

        is being appealed by the County and is expected to be heard by the Appellate 

        Court late summer 2001. </p>

      <p>The case of GPA 96-03 is the culmination of a long political and legal 

        process to reconcile inconsistencies in the San Diego County General Plan 

        that encourage urban development (a.k.a. &quot;<a href="sprawl.htm">Sprawl</a>&quot;) 

        on agricultural and vast rangelands in San Diego's north and east county--the 

        last vestiges of valuable open space for farming, ranching, wildlife habitat, 

        and the protection of natural resources, including water. </p>

      <p>During the past 5 years, SOFAR has tried to defend the public interest 

        in good faith among County decision-makers, other civic organizations 

        and agencies, and the public at-large. Frustratingly, over time SOFAR 

        witnessed an undeniable coordination between the County, the Farm Bureau, 

        and the Building Industry Association (BIA) over the future development 

        of the remaining open spaces of our County. In fact, the BIA carefully 

        watched all developments in this matter and was in attendance at all public 

        meetings concerning it. </p>

      <p>While we continue to hope for a more positive response from the County 

        pertaining to our precious natural resources, the current posturing that 

        the County proposal for GPA 96-03 is for the enhancement of agriculture 

        discourages us. </p>

      <p>SOFAR argues that GPA 96-03 encourages the fragmentation of wide-open 

        rangelands and wildlife habitat, the destruction of valuable watershed, 

        and discourages the large-scale ranching operations that enhance our economy, 

        our scenic vistas and our rural heritage with huge impacts that the County 

        admits are UNMITIGABLE. </p>

      <p>For interesting reading, see the following sketch of key stages in the 

        history of GPA 96-03 up to today. (Examples of scheming by the County, 

        Farm Bureau and/or BIA are indicated with **.)</p>

      <p>1995 SOFAR challenges County of San Diego in Superior Court for urban-style 

        zoning (8-acre parcels) on 200,000 acres of rangeland preserves in San 

        Diego backcountry. </p>

      <p>Court declares General Plan inadequate because of a missing Agricultural 

        Element and illegal urban zoning on rangelands. Concurrently, the Court 

        declares a Moratorium on development on Agricultural and grazing Preserves. 

      </p>

      <p>**The Building Industry Association (BIA) enters an Amicus Brief (Friend 

        of the Court Brief) saying the Moratorium placed on agricultural lands 

        will have a &quot;chilling effect on the housing industry.&quot; </p>

      <p><strong>1996 </strong>** Farm Bureau proposes 10-acre zoning to the County 

        for most agricultural lands. County accepts their proposal and submits 

        it to the Court. </p>

      <p>SOFAR argues the County plan is without merit. Court agrees and orders 

        County to try again, and come back in 6 months. </p>

      <p>**After Court appearance, SOFAR, in an effort to determine who is advising 

        the County, discovers that the County's &quot;advisor&quot; on agricultural 

        zoning was the chief counsel for PARDEE Construction Co. </p>

      <p><strong>1997</strong> SOFAR, with growing realization that Farm Bureau, 

        BIA, and County are conspiring to sell-out the backcountry, starts the 

        Initiative process to correct for the failure in leadership in our administration 

        to decide for the public interest. <br>

        The Rural Heritage &amp; Watershed Initiative was premised on the implementation 

        of the rural zoning outlined in the missing Agricultural Element (and 

        referred to in the Conservation and Open Space Elements) with a so-called 

        urban-rural boundary. In essence, the Initiative aimed to correct for 

        the legislative failure of the County to implement its own Plan.</p>

      <p><strong>1997</strong> (December) County orders taxpayer funded $50,000 

        study on the Initiative. Study questions are deceptive and use strongly 

        judgmental language (i.e. they assumed blanket impacts on all areas of 

        the county, whether or not the initiative was shown BY INDEPENDENT studies 

        to incur impacts. In addition, the study questions presumed the nature 

        of all effects of the initiative to be negative).</p>

      <p><strong>1998 </strong>(February) **National Association of Homebuilders 

        conducts large-scale survey of San Diego households to determine campaign 

        strategy on the Initiative before the initiative even qualified for the 

        ballot.</p>

      <p> (February) **Board of Supervisors, in one of the more blatant attempts 

        to thwart the Initiative's success, directs the County's Chief Administrative 

        Officer to seek urgency legislation to limit the ability of 84% of County 

        voters from voting on General Plan and zoning initiatives that have County-wide 

        impacts. County was unable to gather local and state support and abandoned 

        this attempt to keep the Initiative off the ballot.</p>

      <p>** County withdraws part of its report (section on traffic) because it 

        was found to be heavily laden with bias and false documentation. </p>

      <p>** Chief of Staff for Supervisor Ron Roberts, Steve Dannon, takes a leave 

        of absence to work for the campaign against the Initiative. </p>

      <p>**Supervisor Pan Slater becomes a signatory on the ballot arguments in 

        opposition to the Initiative (Prop. B).</p>

      <p>County continues working on GPA 96-03. In addition, planning for the 

        overhaul of the County's General Plan (a.k.a. GP 2020) launches.</p>

      <p>(November) the Rural Heritage &amp; Watershed Initiative (Proposition 

        B) failed to achieve enough votes to implement rural zoning on the County's 

        agricultural and rural lands and subsequently filed a <a href="pra.htm">successful 

        lawsuit</a> against the County for Public Records Act violations relating 

        to campaigning against the Initiative. </p>

      <p><strong>1999</strong> SOFAR continued the waiting game while the County 

        prepared its Environmental Impact Report, which was finally released 3 

        years after the original Court-designated deadline.</p>

      <p><strong>2000</strong> In the name of &quot;enhancing agriculture&quot; 

        in San Diego County, (See County Proposal for further detail as well as 

        <a href="DrWoods.htm">SOFAR's analysis</a>) the County&#8217;s final plan 

        for GPA 96-03 proposed to:</p>

      <ul>

        <li>Implement 10-acre zoning on current Agricultural Preserve lands west 

          of the County Water Authority line with one dwelling unit per parcel, 

          and 40-acres east of the line encouraging ranchette-style development;<br>

          <br>

        </li>

        <li> Suppose that farming that is currently unsuccessful in areas with 

          irrigation and service will be successful further out into the backcountry. 

          <br>

          <br>

        </li>

        <li> Endorse Overriding Considerations for this Amendment to permit the 

          complete grading (clearing) of 200,000 acres without any environmental 

          review.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>**The day the matter came before the Planning Commission, the Farm Bureau 

        dropped its preferred alternative and sided with the County's proposal 

        for GPA 96-03. </p>

      <p>(March) The San Diego County Planning Commission heard testimony on GPA 

        96-03 and was unable to achieve enough votes necessary to approve the 

        staff recommendation to the Board of Supervisors.</p>

      <p>(April) GPA 96-03 was adopted by the Board of Supervisors, based on a 

        Statement of Overriding Considerations to allow intensive development 

        on almost 200,000 acres of San Diego County backcountry.</p>

      <p>(May) SOFAR files another lawsuit against county.</p>

      <p><br>

        (June) Califoria Attorney General enters lawsuit on the side of SOFAR, 

        and EPA issues a statement supporting SOFAR's efforts.</p>

      <p><br>

        (August) SOFAR wins in court for the third time.</p>

      <p>(November) The County appealed Judge Judith McConnell's ruling to the 

        Appellate Court.</p>

      <p></p>

      <p>2001 The hearing by the Appellate Court has been extended to late summer 

        2001.</p>

      <p>(September) County drops appeal and starts work to issue a &quot;NEW&quot; 

        environmental impact report on substantially the same project they just 

        lost on.</p>

      <p><br>

        2002 (January) County issues &quot;NEW&quot; draft EIR.</p>

      <p><br>

        (February) Planning commision approves EIR and forwards recommendation 

        to approve to board of supervisors.</p>
