      <blockquote>On December 9, 1999, the County’s Planning &amp; Environmental 
        Review Board (PERB) denied the Tentative Map Replacement application for 
        Ramona Ridge Estates. The applicant has until December 20 to appeal the 
        decision, as he is expected to do. The Planning Commission will hear the 
        appeal on January 7, 2000. This proposed project would put 18 lots with 
        8-acre minimum lot sizes on 215 acres of Agricultural Preserve farmlands. 
        This size lot is incompatible with maintaining viable agriculture. It 
        would also put estate home sites at the base of Whale Mountain, a nesting 
        site for Golden Eagles.</blockquote>
      <p><font size="2"><u><strong>ALPINE RANCH ESTATES WEST II</strong></u></font></p>
      <blockquote>Alpine Ranch Estates West II was approved by PERB on December 
        16, 1999. This subdivision of 224 acres into 67 housing lots will put 
        estate homes on ridge lines and forever fragment this area of chaparral-covered 
        hills and canyons of Alpine. </blockquote>
      <p><font size="2"><u><strong>JACUMBA VALLEY RANCH</strong></u></font></p>
      <blockquote>The hearing before the Planning Commission for Jacumba Valley 
        Ranch has been continued until January 21, 2000. This is to enable Planning 
        Commissioner Dave Kreitzer an opportunity to take a field trip to the 
        proposed project site. The massive project consists of 1,048 dwelling 
        units, a 200-room hotel, congregate care facility, commercial area, and 
        golf course on 1,250 acres of farm and grazing land. This enormous project 
        would overwhelm the tiny rural town of Jacumba, devastate several hundred 
        acres of prime farmland, and destroy the ranching heritage and natural 
        beauty of this area of East County.</blockquote>
