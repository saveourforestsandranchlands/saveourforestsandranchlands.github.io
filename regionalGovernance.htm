        Submitted by SOFAR:</font></strong></u></p>

      

      <p>July 25, 2001 </p>

      <p>Honorable Byron Wear, Chairman<br>

        Regional Government Efficiency Commission<br>

        1230 Third Ave.<br>

        Suite 224<br>

        San Diego, CA 92101</p>

      <p><br>

        Dear Chairman Wear, </p>

      <p>Save Our Forest And Ranchlands (SOFAR) is a grass-roots organization 

        dedicated to the protection of the wilderness, watershed, agricultural, 

        and scenic resources of San Diego County. We are composed of concerned 

        citizens and experts in the fields of land use, conservation of natural 

        resources, land planning, and biology. Additionally, we are the court-approved 

        land use authority for 250,000 acres of rural San Diego backcountry due 

        to our sustained and successful efforts to defend against inappropriate 

        conversion of wildlands to development. </p>

      <p>Today, we respectfully submit our comments to the Regional Government 

        Efficiency Commission (RGEC) as they prepare to tender their recommendations 

        to the Governor of California for plans to coordinate transportation planning 

        efforts in an expanded or new form of regional government for the San 

        Diego region. </p>

      <p>SOFAR is concerned that RGEC is repeating the same level of thinking 

        that created the intractable problems it is supposed to resolve. SOFAR 

        acknowledges the need for a logical consolidation of governing agencies. 

        However, we believe that planning, not governance, is the necessary first 

        step in solving San Diego's regional growth problems. First, adopt 

        a plan to tackle sprawl, then empower existing agencies to administer 

        the plan. </p>

      <p>There is precedence for putting the plan first. In 1988, San Diego County 

        voters endorsed the establishment of such a plan when they voted for a 

        &#8220;Regional Planning and Growth Control Measure.&#8221; The text of 

        the Proposition they endorsed conferred regulatory power&#8212;enforceable 

        authority&#8212;upon the Regional Growth Management Review Board. Ultimately, 

        SANDAG was established as the Review Board, and five years later, it adopted 

        a Plan to resolve regional problems associated with haphazard development. 

      </p>

      <p>We all know that this Plan has never been implemented, chiefly because 

        fragmented decision-making preordains that meaningful action will be lost 

        to unproductive (albeit amiable) &#8220;consensus-building.&#8221; Still, 

        RGEC proposes to introduce another provincially elected governing body 

        to correct where SANDAG has failed, which delays implementation of a regional 

        plan even longer. </p>

      <p>RGEC would be wise to observe that Portland's Metro, the model 

        for RGEC's new plan, did not achieve its high standard of living 

        by first establishing a governing body. Rather, it began with a plan, 

        a plan that defined the limits of, and programmed the timing of, urban 

        development. Metro's governance structure came after the Oregon 

        Growth Management Plan had been legally enacted. </p>

      <p>Therefore, SOFAR proposes that RGEC's primary task is to institute 

        a regional plan to stem the tide of urban sprawl. If implemented, a regional 

        plan will improve integrated transportation, land use, and open space 

        planning exponentially. SOFAR argues that an Urban Growth Boundary is 

        a sensible, logical, effective tool to bring about this fundamental shift. 

      </p>

      <p>In June 2000, the Public Policy Institute surveyed 2000 San Diego County 

        residents about their attitudes toward growth and governance in the region. 

        The results are astounding, and they support SOFAR's position on 

        this matter. Significantly, the poll indicates that voters do not have 

        confidence in government and that they believe that greed and corruption, 

        lack of effective planning, and overdevelopment in the wrong places are 

        among the serious problems of the region. Furthermore, 67% of voters support 

        the establishment of an Urban Growth Boundary in the County. Clearly, 

        the voters have witnessed the inability of government to stand up for 

        their interests and they see that defined urban limits would help respond 

        to that need. </p>

      <p>The table below is a partial reproduction of the poll's results.

      <p>A coordinated and sustainable approach to land use and transportation 

        planning&#8212;must be brought before the voters as a first step. RGEC's 

        current recommendations are merely replacing one form of governance with 

        another. For decades, this region has not been able to overcome provincial 

        thinking to act in the best interest of the region. </p>

      <p>What the current RGEC recommendations fail to recognize is that the San 

        Diego leadership crisis is itself a symptom of sprawl politics. And, along 

        with the other resource crises of housing, infrastructure, beach pollution, 

        traffic congestion, and environmental degradation, will never be cured 

        by tinkering with symptoms, i.e., more leaders or more freeways. </p>

      <p>If we are truly interested in meaningful change, we must address the 

        cause of our problems and enact a new plan. </p>

      <p>Thank you very much for the opportunity to comment on this most important 

        issue. </p>

      <p>Sincerely, </p>
