    <TD> <p><strong>Our Mission</strong></p>
      <p>Save Our Forest and Ranchlands is dedicated to the protection of the 
        wilderness, watershed, and agricultural resources of San Diego County 
        through proper land use planning.</p>
      <p>We believe Urban Sprawl to be the #1 threat to our natural resources 
        and to the quality of life in San Diego.</p>
      <p>In this endeavor, we review and comment on EIRs and project proposals 
        and speak at community forums on land use issues to educate the public 
        and our decision-makers.</p>

      <p><strong>Background Narrative</strong> </p>
      <p><a href="achievements.htm">Achievements</a> </p>
      <p>San Diego is blessed with all the elements of paradise - bountiful land, 
        a beautiful coast line, Mediterranean climate, a deep water port, nearby 
        pine covered mountains, majestic valleys, valuable watershed and desert 
        retreats. But, we could lose it all to poorly planned development otherwise 
        known as sprawl. Special interest politics driven by land speculators 
        have generally held sway over all Southern California. Los Angeles and 
        Orange County are textbook cases of legislative land use failures that 
        have produced uncontrolled development detrimental to both our economy 
        and our quality of life.</p>
      <p>Urban Sprawl's harmful effects on both the cities and rural lands of 
        America has received National attention in such publications as the Bank 
        of America report &quot;Beyond Sprawl&quot;, The American Farmland Trust 
        magazine Special Editions on Sprawl, The American City &amp; County Magazine 
        and The Regionalist. These publications all agree that it is the politics 
        of land use that lie at the heart of the problem of sprawl: the art of 
        planning has been replaced by the craft of salesmanship.</p>
      <p><em>Sprawl is, in essence, the subsidizing of special interests by the 
        American taxpayers.</em></p>
      <p>The answer, therefore, to the problem of sprawl is leadership i.e., leadership 
        for the common good. Instead of throwing taxpayer money at the symptoms 
        of misplanning i.e., building more freeways to service ever more distant 
        suburbs, we need leaders to follow the advice that professionals have 
        been giving us for decades.</p>
      <p>In San Diego County, the <a href="history.htm">legislative failure</a> 
        to adequately plan for resource protection dates back to at least the 
        mid-to-late 1970's, when the State of California mandated that every city 
        and county adopt an Open Space and Conservation Element to their General 
        Plan.</p>
      <p>In addition, in 1978, San Diego County mandated the adoption of an Agriculture 
        Element. The legislative process by which the Open Space and Conservation 
        Elements were adopted in San Diego County was so weighted with special 
        interests that these elements ended up having no regulatory effect.</p>
      <p>The Agriculture Element was supposed to designate exclusive agricultural 
        areas and analyze, improve, and promote methods of preserving agriculture 
        throughout the County. The Draft Agriculture Element was published in 
        1979 after two years of exhaustive economic and land use study and at 
        a cost of over half a million dollars. This Agriculture Element, which 
        contemplated the redesignation and rezone of 600,000 acres of agricultural 
        resource land, was never adopted.</p>
      <p>With the Open Space and Conservation Elements functioning as a masquerade 
        for development and the Agriculture Element missing altogether, urban 
        zoning remained over all land in San Diego County including wilderness, 
        scenic, watershed, and agriculture land. Frustration with the lack of 
        planning for these important rural lands led to legal challenges and citizen-drafted 
        initiatives. In 1992, Save Our Forests and Ranchlands (SOFAR) successfully 
        challenged the <strong>Central Mountain Community Plan</strong> for promoting 
        development in the County's private inholdings of the Cleveland National 
        Forest. In 1993, SOFAR drafted the <strong>Forest Conservation Initiative</strong>, 
        approved by County voters, which protected the Cleveland National Forest 
        from small-lot sub divisions by establishing a 40-acre minimum lot size 
        within the Forest's boundaries. In 1995, SOFAR won a lawsuit against the 
        County for inadequate planning for the 400,000 acres of agricultural preserve 
        land in the backcountry. Additionally, the Court noted that the General 
        Plan was inadequate since it lacked the adoption of a mandatory Agriculture 
        Element. A <strong>moratorium</strong> was placed on agricultural preserve 
        land, and the County was ordered to bring its General Plan into compliance 
        with state law. To this date, the County has failed to comply with the 
        Court's order.</p>
      <p>In our search for a solution to the crisis of urban sprawl, our committee 
        has made many discoveries, the most notable of which is the overwhelming 
        response we have received whenever we spoke of the need to save the rural 
        lands of San Diego County. Across the county from planners, from civic 
        leaders, from citizens, from students, from the scientific community, 
        the response has been one and the same: stop urban sprawl. We have been 
        richly rewarded in making many new friends. On the other hand, we have 
        also discovered a darker side to this issue. Some persons are trying to 
        use County government, not to achieve the common good, but to serve the 
        special interests of money and power. </p>
      <p>Today, land speculators are attempting to influence the planning process 
        to sway land use decisions in their favor. We have discovered late, but 
        not too late, that there is another way. The courts have long affirmed 
        that inherent in the life of a community is the absolute power to rule, 
        plan, and guide itself. Indeed, the formal rights of a community to ensure 
        that the heritage of the past and the benefits of a just and rational 
        society extend in full measure to the public at large outweigh the material 
        claims of some to enrich themselves to the detriment of that same community. 
        &quot;It is thoroughly established in this Country that the rights preserved 
        to the individual by these constitutional provisions are held in subordination 
        to the rights of society. Although one owns property he may not do with 
        it as he pleases any more than he can act in accordance with his personal 
        desires.&quot; (HFH - G) Furthermore, &quot;Landowners do not have a vested 
        right in zoning classifications.&quot; (HFH - G)</p>
      <p>Biologists are agreed that fragmentation of habitat is the fundamental 
        cause of the deterioration of our natural resources. In the past, we have 
        divided our lands and then attempted to make them whole through mitigation 
        measures. These measures have universally failed. Soule's studies in Southern 
        California give dramatic evidence to this point. We have mitigated Southern 
        California to the point where it is now called the epicenter of extinction 
        in North America. This is the type of planning and thinking that we utterly 
        reject. Our rural lands by some miracle have escaped the hand of planners, 
        mitigators, and developers. The answer to what our rural lands need is 
        simple: stewardship, an ancient and noble concept. By it 's very nature, 
        the backcountry is a self-contained, self-maintained entity capable of 
        providing for all its needs as well as providing nourishment for all human 
        beings as long as our use does not change its fundamental core. Fragment 
        it, disturb it, mitigate it, and you will destroy it.</p>
      <p>In 1997, the Rural Heritage &amp; Watershed Initiative was filed by a 
        broad coalition of concerned citizens, planning and conservation experts, 
        landowners, and political leaders. The most comprehensive land use initiative 
        in the County's history, the RHWI would have amended the General Plan 
        by establishing an urban-rural boundary. This boundary would have protected 
        the backcountry from inappropriate development and prevented uncontrolled 
        urban sprawl. This plan also, in effect, ;encouraged the revitalization 
        of the County's established cities and suburbs. Finally, after 20 years 
        of mismanagement by politicians, we, through initiative process, presented 
        a real choice for the voters of San Diego county: a plan for livable cities 
        and a sustainable backcountry. It was called the Rural Heritage and Watershed 
        Initiative. Disastrously, the Initiative failed to achieve a majority 
        of voter approval after a campaign of deception managed to dissuade voters 
        from the positive benefits that would accrue.</p>
      <p>Today, SOFAR remains committed to its mission and works project by project 
        to preserve what remains of our beautiful backcountry. We believe that 
        our efforts are appreciated by the citizens who value rural areas and 
        natural resources for their inherent worth, not for the development value 
        of the land. Therefore, we must continue to rely on our members for support, 
        financially and as activists who will stand behind truth.</p>
