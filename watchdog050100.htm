	  <blockquote> The Planning &amp; Environmental Review Board denied a request 

        for a time extension for this project. The project divided 133 acres of 

        backcountry farmland, much of it located in Land Use Designator Ag 19 

        – Intensive Agriculture – and containing prime soil, into 45 estate housing 

        lots. The project was located in Goose Valley, a bucolic farming valley 

        just east of the country town of Ramona. SOFAR had suggested that this 

        project be denied based on its outdated and inadequate biological studies, 

        inconsistency with General Plan and Community Plan goals, growth-inducing 

        and cumulative impacts, and significance of the loss of prime agricultural 

        soil. </blockquote>

	  <blockquote>The County has required the developer of this proposed project 

        to complete an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) before the project will 

        be considered. This project would put 105 homes on a 126-acre productive 

        avocado grove. SOFAR had recommended that an EIR be completed on this 

        project due to its impact on agriculture, inconsistency with the General 

        Plan, growth-inducing and cumulative impacts, and inability to meeting 

        the findings for a major use permit.</blockquote>

      <blockquote> June 14, 2000 is the hearing date before the Board of Supervisors 

        for the Jacumba Valley Ranch project. This ill-conceived proposed project 

        would put 1,048 homes, golf course, hotel, congregate care facility, and 

        commercial space on 1,250 acres of farmland. The majority of the property 

        is river bottom prime soil and has been farmed. A portion of Round Mountain, 

        sacred to Native Americans, occupies the northwest corner of the project 

        site. SOFAR adamantly opposes this project and has engaged experts to 

        review and comment on it.</blockquote>
