      <p>SOFAR is a membership-based group. Membership contributions enable us
        to continue to engage the help of experts from the fields of planning,
        land use law, and biological sciences, which support our efforts defending
        the San Diego backcountry. We are actively working on several campaigns
        that threaten to diminish the integrity of San Diego County. We invite
        you to join our efforts by sending a generous contribution to the address
        listed above or by volunteering time to our campaign efforts. Please call,
        write, or email us today!</p></TD>
