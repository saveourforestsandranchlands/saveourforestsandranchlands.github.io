      <p><strong>Subject: EIR for San Diego County GPA 96-03</strong></p>

      <p>Dear Nancy Woo,</p>

      <p>I received a copy of your April 4th letter in which you substantially 

        alter the statements you made in a March 31st letter about water quality 

        impacts associated with the County's GPA 96-03. I am writing to share 

        with you the results of your revised letter at the April 5th Board hearing 

        on GPA 96-03.</p>

      <p>In your first letter, you correctly perceived and concluded that the 

        massive chance in type of land use and increase in density over 200,000 

        acres of San Diego's wildlands would have enormous water quality impacts 

        and put drinking water reservoirs at risk. This letter rightfully caused 

        great concern on the part of public officials and agencies in charge of 

        watershed management. Your first letter was absolutely true and based 

        on a correct description of both the project and the nature of the lands 

        in question.</p>

      <p>The on-ground density of the lands evaluated in the EIR for GPA 96-03, 

        east of the County Water Authority tine, is roughly one dwelling unit 

        per 600 acres as revealed in the EIR itself. In many cases, huge grazing 

        areas like the Guejuita Ranch, Santa Ysabel Valley, and San Felipe Ranch 

        have a density of one home per 5,000 acres. In the County&#8217;s proposal, 

        they evaluated the effects of &quot;a total clearing&quot; of the landscape 

        in these areas and a change from on-ground density to a planning density 

        of one dwelling unit per forty acres. This change from ground to plan 

        represents roughly a 500% increase in population density with all associated 

        impacts.</p>

      <p>On the question of land use, the assumption of &quot;total clearing&quot; 

        was based on the concept of a radical change in use from undisturbed wildland 

        agriculture to intensive agriculture that would radically alter the landscape.</p>

      <p>The EIR amazingly stated that once overriding considerations were stoned 

        for the unmitigable impacts in virtually <u>every CEQA category</u>, that there 

        would be no further environmental review for clearing of lands for agricultural 

        uses.</p>

      <p>In one of the most naked displays of political manipulation, the County 

        seized upon a phrase in your first letter that characterized the change 

        in density as an &quot;UPZONE.&quot; They apparently tricked the EPA into 

        believing that this was wrong and that since &quot;the current zoning 

        was 8-acres, the 40-acre proposal was instead a DOWNZONE&quot; and a decrease 

        in density that would have beneficial impacts!</p>

      <p>This is political chicanery at its worst.</p>

      <p>It is especially egregious because County officials took advantage of 

        your lack of knowledge of technical terminology <em>knowing full well</em> 

        that to compare the current proposal with what the Courts ruled to be 

        totally illegal (8-acre zoning) was what CEQA calls a &quot;Plan to Plan 

        Comparison&quot; which is expressly PROHIBITED BY LAW in evaluating the 

        impacts of a proposed project.</p>

      <p>Specifically, courts have held that where a proposed project is an agency 

        decision changing planning or zoning designations, its potential impacts 

        should not be compared only with those that would ultimately occur, with 

        buildout, under an existing plan. Rather, the analysis should focus on 

        &quot;existing physical conditions&quot; before comparing the eventual 

        future conditions that would result under build out pursuant to both the 

        existing and contemplated plan. CEQA Guidelines Section 15125 (e), Christward 

        Ministry v. Superior Court (4th Dist. 1986) 184 Cal.App. 3d 180, 190-191 

        (quoted from the guide to the California Environmental Quality Act authored 

        by Michael H. Remy and Tina A. Thomas, 1999, page 375.)</p>

      <p>Eight acre zoning on Ag Preserve land was invalidated by Court action. 

        The only comparison allowed by CEQA is an evaluation of the project's 

        impacts against the actual environment as it exists on the ground today. 

        Thus, I am affirming again that your original letter was right in both 

        form and content. The 40-acre density represents a MASSIVE INCREASE compared 

        to the ground.</p>

      <p>Comparing the forty acres to the former illegal eight acres was wrong, 

        deceitful, and ultimately meaningless. The EPA was deceived into changing 

        their first letter in order to serve special political interests prior 

        to one of the most important land use decisions in San Diego's history. 

        As a result of your second letter, the Supervisors and planning staff 

        apparently felt that one of the most significant unmitigable impacts of 

        the project -water quality&shy; was no longer an item for discussion.</p>

      <p>They passed GPA 96-03 unanimously. They failed to note that the EPA continued 

        to correctly acknowledge the impacts of the project on regional water 

        quality.</p>

      <p>We deeply regret that the EPA was subject to the kind of political intrigue 

        that compromised your integrity and that must have embarrassed your staff. 

        Rest assured, Save Our Forests will pursue this matter and vindicate your 

        original judgment as to the actual impacts of the County's proposal.</p>

      <p>Sincerely yours,<br>
