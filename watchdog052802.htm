  	<TD><p><strong><u>TUNE IN TO KPBS RADIO PROGRAM</u></strong></p>

      <blockquote>SOFAR would like to encourage all of our supporters to tune into KPBS 

        (89.5 FM) for a very important debate regarding San Diego County's land 

        use policies, especially in light of SOFAR's settlement of the Agricultural 

        Preserve lawsuit. The program will air at 9:00 AM tomorrow, May 29th. 

        SOFAR's President, Duncan McFetridge will be participating in this discussion 

        along with San Diego County Supervisor Pam Slater. Henry Richmond will 

        begin the program by relating Oregon's urban growth boundary law with 

        San Diego's current growth management problems. </blockquote>

      <p><strong><u>A REMINDER OF SOFAR'S POSITION</u></strong></p>

      <blockquote>It is SOFAR's position that in one of the most important public interest 

        lawsuits in our County's history, the Supervisors action on 200,000 acres 

        of Ag Preserve land was a policy failure and a land use disaster that 

        weakens any future planning efforts, such as the 2020 plan. SOFAR settled 

        this case because CEQA is primarily an informational procedure and cannot 

        force the county to make the fundamental policy changes needed to protect 

        our backcountry. In essence, this case raised the issue of whether land 

        is a community resource that should be used sustainably for the public 

        good, or whether it is a commodity to be bought and sold by special interests. 

      </blockquote>

      <p><strong><u>THE GOOD GUYS</u></strong></p>

      <blockquote>Throughout this six-year court battle, SOFAR argued for the integrity 

        and importance of the General Plan as the key for sustainable growth and 

        protection of public resources. We relied upon the State Planning Law 

        (Code 65030) which states, &quot;The General Plan laws were enacted with 

        the recognition that &quot;'California's land is an exhaustible resource, 

        not just a commodity, and is essential to the economy, environment, and 

        general well-being of the people '&quot;. In the conclusions that we drew 

        from this position and upon which we filed each successful lawsuit, we 

        were joined by other independent parties who drew the same conclusions; 

        the Environmental Protection Agency, the California State Attorney General, 

        scientists, economists, planning professionals, and numerous environmental 

        groups. The San Diego Union-Tribune voiced similar outrage about the &quot;Derelict 

        Board's&quot; land use planning failures. And, of course, the Superior 

        Court agreed with SOFAR's position on the law. </blockquote>

      <p><strong><u>THE BAD GUYS</u></strong></p>

      <blockquote>The County, on the other hand, has continually argued this case from 

        the position that land is a marketable commodity. In a demonstration of 

        this position, the County teamed up in court with the Building Industry, 

        the Farm Bureau, and the Pacific Legal Foundation (a private property 

        advocacy group) to argue one and only one cause; to preserve development 

        potential of the last of San Diego's resource rich lands. </blockquote>
