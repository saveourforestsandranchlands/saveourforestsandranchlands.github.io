        <blockquote>

		Our downtown office is humming smoothly along now, thanks to Duncan&#8217;s 

        leadership and Lynne&#8217;s cheerful and attentive efforts. Stop by if 

        you&#8217;re downtown (440 11th Avenue) and say hello! </blockquote>

      <p><font size="2"><strong><u>Star Party</u></strong></font></p>

        <blockquote>Thanks to all who came to our Star Party on October 22nd. Attendees were 

        treated to an outstanding autumn evening at the observatory on Mount Laguna, 

        and shared poetry, music, good food, old and new friends, and, of course 

        millions of brilliant stars! Many said this was one of our best events 

        yet! Gracious thanks to all who volunteered their time and energy to make 

        this event a success. And if you didn&#8217;t make it this year, make 

        sure you come next time! </blockquote>

      <p><font size="2"><strong><u>Regional Planning</u></strong></font></p>

        

      <blockquote> SOFAR continues to weigh in on the proposal to reform regional 

        governance in San Diego. Even though the legislature didn&#8217;t forward 

        RGEC&#8217;s recommendations related to governance (see Watchdog August 

        31st), SOFAR is still promoting the enactment of a regional plan prior 

        to governmental reorganization. We&#8217;ve sent dozens of letters to 

        our local legislative officials in hopes of receiving their support. SOFAR 

        maintains that new forms of government merely postpone the critical need 

        for a region-wide land use plan implementation. We urge you to let your 

        local elected officials know that you support a regional plan, too. Please 

        click to <a href="http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/politics/contact.html">www.signonsandiego.com/news/politics/contact.html</a> 

        for a very complete listing of local and national political contacts.

      <p><font size="2"><strong><u>Volunteer Help Needed</u></strong></font></p>

        <blockquote>Help contribute to the most successful activist group in San Diego&#8212;SOFAR 

        needs help maintaining its project database. This is an on-going assignment 

        that helps us to continue our role as watchdog of San Diego&#8217;s backcountry. 

        We need a volunteer who is available every week to coordinate with Duncan 

        on significant projects so we can keep our supporters and other interested 

        persons up-to-date with the deluge of development happening in our area. 

        Outside of the government planning departments, SOFAR is the only group 

        maintaining such a list of significant projects online. This is an especially 

        good opportunity for planning students or others interested in learning 

        more about local planning. Call Duncan at 619-230-1963 if you are interested 

        in helping us in this task. </blockquote>

      <p><font size="2"><strong><u>GPA 96-03</u></strong></font></p>

        <blockquote>We have good news on the battle over GPA 96-03 (200,000 acres of agricultural 

        land). The County has officially retreated from their so-called &quot;new 

        EIR&quot; by extending the time period for public comment. Decoding the 

        County's language for the time extension means that after reading the 

        comment letters the County realized they were headed for another legal 

        disaster and decided to buy some more time. We hope that in the &quot;new&quot; 

        time period the County will consider the option of substantially changing 

        their project to serve the public good instead of trying to create new 

        ways to get around an illegal project! Indeed, the County is treading 

        on thin ice in trying to resubmit the very same project that thus far 

        has failed three times to meet legal standards. Stay tuned for another 

        breakthrough. </blockquote>
