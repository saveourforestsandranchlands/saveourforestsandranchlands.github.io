      </p>

      <blockquote> Many thanks for all of your contributions and letters of support 

        to SOFAR this past year. Knowing we have the support of so many members 

        of our regional community reinvigorates our spirits with hope that we 

        can make meaningful progress for sustainable land use planning in San 

        Diego County. Unfortunately, as you will read below, end of the year news 

        demonstrates a continuing trend toward the exact opposite. </blockquote>

      <p> <strong>WE'VE MOVED</strong> </p>

      <blockquote>SOFAR is now in a new office located at 1087 "J" St. in downtown 

        San Diego. The phone (619-230-1963) and fax (619-230-1246) numbers remain 

        the same. </blockquote>

      <p> Other Updates ....... </p>

      <p> <strong>CUYAMACA SEPTIC PERMIT</strong> </p>

      <blockquote>SOFAR has won an important legal victory in the battle over 

        the environmental review of the enormous septic system proposed on pristine 

        meadowland just north of Lake Cuyamaca by the Cuyamaca Lake District. 

        SOFAR's attorneys, Shute, Mihaly and Weinberger argued that due to the 

        failure of the Lake District to fulfill their legal responsibilities to 

        account for all environmental impacts of the project, that the Regional 

        Water Quality Control Board must by law assume lead agency status and 

        responsibility for assuring CEQA compliance. The Water Quality Board has 

        officially accepted a lead agency status and a full EIR will be conducted. 

      </blockquote>

      <blockquote> A solution already exists to solve what has become an embarrassing 

        and ultimately unworkable project for the Cuyamaca Lake District. The 

        property proposed for the septic system could be transferred to the State 

        Park system and the Lake district's waste disposal needs can be solved 

        by using State Park facilities to the south of the lake. SOFAR encourages 

        the adoption of this plan. </blockquote>

      <p> <strong>STONEGATE MEMOS REVEAL CORRUPTION</strong> </p>

      <blockquote>Recently obtained memoranda from the Stonegate Development Company 

        of Laguna Hills confirms an organized attempt to delay San Diego County's 

        General Plan 2020 process until certain development projects could gain 

        approval from the Board of Supervisors. The memoranda, released under 

        deposition to San Diego attorney Michael Aguirre, outlined a long and 

        broad-based effort on the part of developer interests to squelch the original 

        maps proposed under GP-2020. Stonegate's plan, as outlined in a series 

        of memos from June 2000 to April 2001, was to intentionally delay the 

        entire GP-2020 process - working with the full cooperation and participation 

        of staff members of the Board of Supervisors, notably current Board of 

        Supervisors' chairman Bill Horn. </blockquote>

      <blockquote> "PLAN 2020 DERAILED!!" begins a February 28, 2001 memorandum 

        from Stonegate Development Company president David Youde. "Due to the 

        concerted effort of David Shibley of the SOLV (Save Our Land Values) GROUP 

        and hundreds of angry landowners, the Board of Supervisors squelched Alternative 

        III of the General Plan 2020 update. This was an important battle victory. 

        It is not the whole war, but it did delay the process and provide us a 

        window of opportunity to move our projects forward," added Youde. </blockquote>

      <blockquote> "Two election cycles have come and gone since the 2020 process 

        began," said Lakeside Planning Group Chairman Gordon Shackelford. "This 

        has proved devastating to the community planning groups and most likely 

        provided political cover for the Supervisors to sell out the unincorporated 

        areas to land speculation interests." </blockquote>

      <blockquote> The original GP-2020 maps - known as the Alternative III maps 

        and drawn by a steering committee made up of planning group leaders from 

        the 17 unincorporated communities within San Diego County - was rejected 

        by the Board of Supervisors on January 10, 2001. Developers wanted less 

        density - with the population spread over a greater area of land through 

        out the County. These recently released memoranda from Stonegate now make 

        clear they went to great lengths to organize and get the results they 

        wanted. </blockquote>

      <blockquote> "Since the Ramona Planning Group spent considerable time and 

        effort in creating and voting on the Aternative III community planning 

        maps ... the magnitude of the information in the memos may significantly 

        affect the future actions of the county planning groups as they reconsider 

        their original and subsequent deliberations over the 2020 plan," said 

        SOFAR president Duncan McFetridge. </blockquote>

      <blockquote> SOFAR, which has successfully sued the Board of Supervisors 

        on five different occasions over their land use decisions, has long alleged 

        that an institutionalized corruption existed in which the County Department 

        of Planning and Land-Use and the Board of Supervisors actually prevented 

        proper planning from taking place. McFetridge said the process has made 

        the public very cynical about it's government. </blockquote>

      <blockquote> "This whole process is a charade. The developers are acting 

        in bad faith and the county goes along with everything they say," added 

        McFetridge. "They don't want any type of plan that prevents them from 

        doing what they want to do, and they use these meetings as a way to stall 

        and corrupt the planning process while they go on building. It's common 

        knowledge to say that land use politics is corrupt in San Diego County, 

        but now we have a smoking gun of why our beaches are polluted, gridlock 

        exists on our freeways, environmental destruction regularly takes place, 

        and a housing shortage crises exists in this county. Special interests 

        have controlled the decision making process in land use matters in San 

        Diego," said McFetridge. </blockquote>

      <p> <strong>PERB REJECTS BENSON STORAGE FACILITY IN ALPINE </strong></p>

      <blockquote>The San Diego Planning and Environmental Review Board (PERB) 

        unanimously rejected a proposal to build an 81,198 square foot storage 

        complex on 2.87 acres at 2358 Tavern Road in Alpine. Led by planner Lory 

        Nagem-Tavernelli, PERB told the current land owners of the project that 

        building a storage complex of such magnitude would intrude on the neighborhood 

        and be a hazard to Alpine's growing traffic and congestion problems. </blockquote>

      <blockquote> "The neighborhood's character is residential. This project 

        does not agree with Alpine's community plan. It is two miles deep into 

        the residential neighborhoods of Alpine - an area not intended to handle 

        such an intense urban development," said Nagem-Tavernelli. "This project 

        is incompatible with the neighborhood." </blockquote>

      <blockquote> SOFAR president Duncan McFetridge spoke out against the Benson 

        project, citing a letter from the law firm of Shute, Mihaly & Weinberger, 

        which denounced the proposed storage complex as in violation of San Diego 

        County's land use regulations. </blockquote>

      <blockquote> "We can find no evidence that an 82,000 square-foot-storage 

        facility constitutes an allowable use in the Residential land use designation. 

        Rather, this type of large commercial facility, which has no relation 

        to residential uses, appears plainly incompatible with the applicable 

        designation," stated a November 8, 2002 letter to the PERB commissioners. 

      </blockquote>

      <blockquote> PERB commissioner Nagem-Tavernelli agreed with the conclusions 

        of both McFetridge and the Shute, Mihaly & Weinberger letter. </blockquote>

      <blockquote> "SOFAR makes an excellent point. A storage facility is not 

        the same as a school or a church. These are necessities for a community. 

        Another storage facility does not fall under the category of necessity," 

        said Nagem-Tavernelli. </blockquote>

      <p> <strong>LAKESIDE RALPH'S IS BACK</strong> </p>

      <blockquote> "Lakeside citizens have strong feelings about the quality of 

        the Community's natural setting, agricultural history, village-like Town 

        Center and rural residential character."<br>

        Lakeside Design Guidelines, <br>

        July 17, 1989 </blockquote>

      <blockquote> After more than two years in limbo, the proposed Ralph's supermarket 

        project for the corner of Olde Highway 80 and Lake Jennings Parkway in 

        Lakeside is back ... and round two should prove more explosive than the 

        first. As proposed, the Ralph's project would require re-zoning 13 acres 

        of property on Olde Highway 80 between Lake Jennings/Ridge Hill Road to 

        the south and Rios Canyon Road to the north. The plan would abolish the 

        southern portion of Pecan Park Lane, extending Rios Canyon Road all the 

        way to a newly formed t-section with Olde Highway 80. </blockquote>

      <blockquote> The land is currently divided into seven separate parcels with 

        four land-use zones. Single-family residential housing is the primary 

        use designated by the current zoning. Small commercial and industrial 

        uses are the other zoning designations for the property. A five-acre farm 

        dominates the center of the site. A four-acre parcel of fallow land next 

        to it is zoned for single-family houses. </blockquote>

      <blockquote> South Coast Development, the Solana Beach firm in charge of 

        building the shopping center, is asking the Board of Supervisors to re-zone 

        the entire area to C-36 commercial. This designation would allow the developers 

        to build a 94,000 square foot shopping center anchored by a 58,000 square 

        foot Ralph's supermarket. An additional 16,000 square foot building would 

        exist for a drugstore. Two retail shops - 4,500 square feet and 8,550 

        square feet respectively - would be allotted to the shopping center, as 

        would a 3,000 square foot gas station/car wash. A 3,500 square foot fast 

        food restaurant would round out the businesses within the shopping center. 

        A parking lot of 486 spaces with 68 bicycle spaces would be developed 

        within the shopping center. </blockquote>

      <blockquote> "They want to put this abomination less than a mile from my 

        home. The lights from the Wal-Mart/Vons center are two miles away and 

        they make me feel like I live under two moons at night. If this goes in, 

        pretty soon it will be like Alaska, where it never gets totally dark," 

        said Rios Canyon resident Stan Barbeau. </blockquote>

      <p> <strong>BARONA WATER TRANSFER </strong></p>

      <blockquote>SOFAR's attorneys have won a very important procedural battle 

        over whether or not the Barona reservation's proposed water line from 

        San Vincente reservoir was based on an" emergency" and thus exempt from 

        CEQA. Shute, Mihaly and Weinberger argued that a proper reading of the 

        law made it impossible to declare the water shortage on the reservation 

        an emergency because it has been self created by the over drafting of 

        ground water supplies. The city of San Diego agreed and is requiring a 

        full EIR for the proposed water transfer. </blockquote>

      <p> <strong>REGIONAL PROJECTS </strong></p>

      <blockquote>SOFAR is commenting on SANDAG's regional transportation plan 

        (RTP), which is scheduled for certification in March. The RTP appears 

        to be more of a highway plan than a public transit plan and does little 

        to move us from an auto-based land use system. Billions are being spent 

        on road systems, which subsidize sprawl and nothing is being done to mitigate 

        these impacts. </blockquote>

      <blockquote>SOFAR is also concerned that the county's 2020 plan is promoting 

        sprawl in the name of smart growth. We will be commenting on every aspect 

        of this so-called plan. And we continue to point out that while the county 

        is fiddling, San Diego's back county is burning up with a sprawl (see 

        Stonegate story). </blockquote>

      <blockquote>On the imperial irrigation district water transfer, SOFAR's 

        position is that the water transfer should not take place without the 

        adoption of a smart growth land use plan as mitigation for the obvious 

        growth inducing impacts of importing new water supplies. Our current land 

        use policies are using all of the public's built and natural resources 

        in a non-sustainably and socially harmful way. We are socializing the 

        cost of producing and maintaining public resources while developers privatize 

        the profits. Now is the time, before the water is transferred to insist 

        on a sane and healthy city building alternative that benefits people instead 

        of profits. </blockquote>
