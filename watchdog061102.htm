  	<TD><p><strong><u>SOFAR'S INTERN NEEDS A HOME!</u></strong></p>

      <blockquote>A Master's student in planning at the University of York in Toronto has 

        expressed interest in working for SOFAR this summer. We could use her 

        help during this very busy season. Do any of our SOFAR supporters have 

        space, preferably near our downtown office and near public transit, for 

        Lesley to stay? She would be visiting San Diego from July 4th until September 

        1st. If we can help her keep down her expenses, she&#8217;ll be able to 

        devote more time to helping SOFAR. Please call our office if you can help 

        (619.230.1963).</blockquote>

      <p><strong><u>CONGRATULATIONS TO BETSY HELSEL</u></strong></p>

      <blockquote>Daughter of SOFAR's Secretary, Gene Helsel, won the primary for State 

        Assembly office in Pennsylvania. Betsy campaigned on a growth management, 

        Smart Growth platform. Please see www.betsyhelsel.org for details. (We 

        need Betsy in San Diego!)</blockquote>

      <p><strong><u>SOFAR WILL BE LOSING UNIQUE DOWNTOWN OFFICE</u></strong></p>

      <blockquote>Due to Ballpark redevelopment, SOFAR is looking for a new affordable 

        office space. If any of our supporters have creative ideas, please let 

        us know. We need to relocate in October.</blockquote>
