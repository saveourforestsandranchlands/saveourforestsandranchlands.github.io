  	<TD><p><b><u><font size="2">County Counsel Releases Damaging Documents</font></u></b>

		<blockquote>

        The legal team of the Rural Heritage &amp; Watershed Initiative (RHWI) 

        Committee have just scored two victories in their fight under the Public 

        Records Act to have the County of San Diego release a number of documents 

        providing evidence of the County's electioneering effort to thwart 

        RHWI, or Prop B, an important citizen's initiative to stop urban 

        sprawl. RHWI lawyers have sought these documents to show bias on the part 

        of high-ranking public officials regarding Prop B. These documents have 

        been held back by the County under the excuse of deliberative process 

        privilege.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>Earlier this week, County Counsel disclosed the first document after 

        Superior Court Judge Pate ruled that the County had waived its right to 

        not disclose the document. The document was an article written by Jim 

        Gogek of the San Diego Union-Tribune that described illegal campaign activity 

        on the part of public officials especially concerning a carefully rehearsed 

        presentation of the County's report on RHWI made before the Board 

        of Supervisors. In the margin, handwritten notes made by a DPLU official 

        while talking with Larry Prior, the County's Chief Administrative 

        Officer, described investigations into leaks regarding the presentation 

        of the County's RHWI report.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>County Counsel, later in the week, released two other groups of documents 

        that had been described as to authors and circumstances in a privilege 

        log that had been given to RHWI attorneys in preparation for trial. These 

        documents further show the collusion among high-ranking public officials 

        with respect to the formation of the so-called County study of RHWI and 

        its presentation to the Board of Supervisors.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>One group of documents remains from public disclosure. This group includes 

        communications to a Board member, Dianne Jacob. RHWI lawyers will ask 

        Judge Pate for their disclosure at trial scheduled for October 22, 1999.</blockquote>
