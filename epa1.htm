      <p>Diane Jacob, Chair<br>

      San Diego, CA 92101</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>Dear Supervisor Jacob:</p>

      <p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has recently received 

        a copy of an EIR for &quot;Agricultural Issues General Plan Amendment 

        and Implementing Rezone (GPA 96-03).&quot; We understand that though the 

        EIR comment period has past, this rezone issue will be before the San 

        Diego County Board of Supervisors on April 5, 2000. The purpose of this 

        letter is to alert you to a number of concerns we have regarding significant 

        land use changes, such as would be enabled by adoption of GPA 96-03, and 

        hope that you and the other Board members will consider EPA's views in 

        your deliberations.</p>

      <p>The County proposes to redesignate over 200,000 acres of Agricultural 

        Preserve (Ag 20) lands to establish a minimum parcel size of 10 acres 

        per dwelling unit for Ag 20 lands west of the County Water Authority boundary 

        and 40 acres per dwelling unit for Ag 20 lands east of the County Water 

        Authority boundary. According to information provided in the EIR (pages 

        2-4 to 2-15), the proposed project will significantly increase the density 

        of dwellings on both sides of the County Water Authority boundary. For 

        instance, the overall existing density for Ag 20 lands is 137.5 acres 

        per dwelling unit (ac/du), with much lower densities for specific planning 

        areas (e.g., 1,359 ac/du for the Desert Subregional Planning Area; 534 

        ac/du for the Mountain Empire Subregional Planning Area; 430 ac/du for 

        the Julian Community Planning Area; and 335ac/du for the Pala/Pauma Valley 

        Subregional Planning Area). EPA is concerned that the proposed project 

        will contribute to the degradation of several watersheds in San Diego 

        County. Upzoning agricultural land may be the first step towards more 

        intense agricultural practices, with concomitant increases in land clearing 

        and the use of water and hazardous chemicals, and subsequent subdivision 

        into housing and commercial development, with associated roads and other 

        infrastructure. The environmental consequences of these actions can include 

        the loss and/or fragmentation of terrestrial and aquatic habitats, decrease 

        in the region's biodiversity, and degradation of water quality from increased 

        pollutant loadings.</p>

      <p>A particularly troubling aspect of the proposed amendment is that, notwithstanding 

        the fact that GPA 96-03 is expected to result in significant adverse impacts 

        to the environment, including water and biological resources, no feasible 

        mitigation measures have been identified (EIR, ES-3).</p>

      <p>That GPA 96-03 will lead to intensified agricultural and residential/commercial 

        development is indisputable. EPA cautions the county not to underestimate 

        both the amount and significance of water quality impacts that will result. 

        Already, there are 36 federally-listed impaired water bodies in San Diego 

        County (per 1998 Clean Water Act Section 303d List). An increase in the 

        number of impaired water bodies will most likely occur with the proposed 

        conversion of over 200,000 acres of existing grazing land and open space.</p>

      <p>During the last 150 years, most of coastal San Diego County habitats 

        have been lost to</p>

      <p>agriculture and development. California has lost more than 90 percent 

        of its wetlands (as well as most its coastal sage scrub habitat) - - the 

        highest rate of loss in the country. These losses will continue through 

        both regulated and unregulated activities. These activities include converting 

        rangelands to intensive agriculture, draining of wetlands, damaging aquatic 

        sites with off-road vehicles, and developing low-&shy;density &quot;ranchette&quot; 

        housing. This type of development can subtly destroy sensitive areas by 

        damming, draining, and diverting wetlands; and by introducing year-round 

        livestock grazing. These practices retard the ability of wetlands to absorb 

        and filter precipitation and runoff, and result in increased discharges 

        of pollutants to surface- and ground waters such as sediment, fertilizers, 

        herbicides, pesticides, detergents, and oil. These pollution burdens are 

        difficult to solve by using non-point source tools alone.</p>

      <p>GPA 96-03 represents immediate threats to wetlands and surface-and ground 

        waters through:</p>

      <p>(1) the subdivision of existing parcels into smaller &quot;ranchette&quot; 

        parcels;</p>

      <p>(2) changing livestock species, grazing patterns, and stocking rates 

        -- from relatively dispersed cattle grazing to intensive grazing by horses;</p>

      <p>(3) conversion of rangeland into row crops, nurseries, and orchards;</p>

      <p>(4) loss of percolation areas and increased pumping of groundwater,</p>

      <p>(5) the conversion of unirrigated rangeland to irrigated recreational 

        lands (e.g., golf courses and the introduction of fertilizers, herbicides, 

        and pesticides; and,</p>

      <p>(6) subdivision of the existing parcels into conventional suburban development.</p>

      <p>An additional concern is that the anticipated development of Ag 20 lands 

        that are tributary to surface water reservoirs will impact the quality 

        and quantity of the region's drinking water supply.</p>

      <p>Examples of drinking water reservoirs at potential risk are the Otay, 

        Sutherland, Hodges, and El Capitan reservoirs.</p>

      <p>We appreciate the opportunity to offer comments on this proposed General 

        Plan Amendment. If there are any questions regarding our comments please 

        contact Paul Michel at (415) 744-1999.</p>
