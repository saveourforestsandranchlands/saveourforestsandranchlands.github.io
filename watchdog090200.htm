  	<TD><p align="center"><font Size=3><strong><u>WE WON!!!</u></strong></font></p>

      <P>We won!!! Judge Judith McConnell of the Superior Court has ruled that 

        the County of San Diego violated the California Environmental Quality 

        Act by not producing an adequate Environmental Impact Report for General 

        Plan Amendment 96-03. She has ordered the County to prepare a revised 

        EIR that will analyze the expected impacts and actual adverse effects 

        of the project. </p>

      <P>In a nine-page, eloquently written, Statement of Decision, Judge McConnell 

        wrote, “The area affected by GPA 96-03 is a vast expanse of acreage scattered 

        across an extraordinarily diverse part of Southwestern California.” “Sensitive 

        flora and fauna in San Diego County are found, or expected to be found, 

        in astonishing array.” She then took the County to task for its failure 

        to properly study and analyze these vast resources. "It has been said 

        -- and sung -- that 'you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone,' " 

        McConnell wrote. "Yet where (state environmental law) applies, the opposite 

        it true: Citizens and decision makers must, in fact, be informed of what 

        they have before, and not after, it's gone." Additionally, Judge McConnell 

        wrote, “The conclusion that there is no feasible mitigation measure that 

        would address the problems posed by agricultural grading is simply not 

        supported by substantial evidence.” </P>

      <P>The next step is for SOFAR’s legal team to submit a judgement to Judge 

        McConnell that will ask that the decision to adopt GPA 96-03 and its implementing 

        rezoning be vacated and the certification of the EIR for GPA 96-03 be 

        vacated. </P>

      <P>SOFAR would like to thank the California Attorney General, Environmental 

        Protection Agency, Sierra Club, San Diego Audubon Society, California 

        Native Plant Society, Center for Biological Diversity, Surfrider Foundation, 

        San Diego Baykeeper, California Oak Foundation, Environmental Health Coalition, 

        and the Mountain Defense League for their help and assistance in this 

        important court case. But, most of all, we wish to thank YOU, our loyal 

        SOFAR Supporters, for your continuing support! We promise to keep you 

        posted on this momentous issue.</P></TD>
