		<blockquote>SOFAR's legal team 

        just scored a victory with a judge ruling that the County had waived its 

        deliberative process privilege, and that the County would have to turn 

        over to SOFAR the document in question. This document is the Gogek article 

        with Gary Pryor's handwritten notes as he talked with Larry Prior. Not 

        only is this good news in itself, but it provides justification for disclosure 

        of the remaining documents.</blockquote>
