    <TD> <p><strong>2000 GPA 96-03</strong>: For the third time, SOFAR was victorious 

        in its battle against the County for its inadequate planning for our almost 

        200,000 acres of precious backcountry rangelands and wildlands. We were 

        extraordinarily pleased to have two Amicus (Friend of the Court) Briefs 

        entered on behalf of SOFAR&#8217;s position. Attorney General Bill Lockyer 

        entered for the State of California as one Amici and nine state and local 

        organizations entered as party to the other Amici Brief in support of 

        SOFAR&#8217;s lawsuit against the County.</p>

      <p><strong>2000 Alpine Albertson&#8217;s and Lakeside Ralph&#8217;s</strong>: 

        SOFAR teamed up in two coalitions to oppose two chain-market retailers 

        with plans to build large grocery complexes along rural portions of the 

        I-8 corridor. Our coalitions successfully made fair arguments that the 

        impacts from these projects should require a full EIR. In both cases, 

        the proponents voluntarily decided to do full environmental analysis after 

        the persistent efforts of the coalitions indicated firm resolve to challenge 

        the projects.</p>

      <p><strong>1999 Policy I-78 Waiver for Valley Center</strong>: SOFAR opposed 

        the County&#8217;s proposal that Valley Center be granted a blanket waiver 

        of Policy I-78 that requires small waste-water treatment plants be located 

        within one mile of the urban limit line. Due to questions raised by SOFAR 

        about the growth-inducing and precedent-setting aspects of the proposed 

        project, the waiver was dropped.</p>

      <p><strong>1998 Ramona Airport Expansion Appeal</strong>: SOFAR, along with 

        Save Ramona and Ramonans for Sensible Growth, won a greatly changed plan 

        when they appealed the Planning Commission&#8217;s decision to expand 

        the Ramona Airport. The original proposal with its potential increase 

        in traffic, infrastructure, and industrial uses had regional implications. 

        The proposed Ramona Airport expansion would have served as the anchor 

        for development along the Highway 67/78 corridor and opened up for development 

        thousands of acres of backcountry from Santa Ysabel to Julian.</p>

      <p><strong>1997 Oaks at Descanso RV Park</strong>: SOFAR prevailed in a 

        lawsuit against the County&#8217;s approval of this massive RV park at 

        the entrance to Cuyamuca Rancho State Park and the Cleveland National 

        Forest. The court ruled the EIR inadequate and set precedent that Major 

        Use Permit findings had to be consistent with the General Plan policies 

        and zoning. Eleven Planning and Sponsor Groups opposed the project.</p>

      <p><strong>1997 Mountain Lion Protection</strong>: SOFAR&#8217;s lawsuit 

        stopped a residential development that would have severed the last mountain 

        lion corridor connecting the Santa Rosa Mountain Range in Orange County 

        and Palomar Mountain in San Diego County. This linkage provides the wildlife 

        corridor that allows for great biodiversity of regional significance. 

        This successful lawsuit, won at the appellate court, set a precedent in 

        requiring a site-specific EIR to account for offsite issues such as a 

        wildlife corridor. The Sierra Club joined us in this lawsuit.</p>

      <p><strong>1996 Turkey Release Halted</strong>: This release-for-hunting 

        program, set up by the California Department of Fish &amp; Game, lacked 

        environmental documentation of the potential impacts on the Cleveland 

        National Forest. This program was stopped through legal action by the 

        California Native Plant Society, SOFAR, and the Sierra Club. This lawsuit 

        won protection for our Forest from the unstudied impacts of the introduction 

        of exotic species.</p>

      <p><strong>1995 Agricultural Preserve Lands</strong>: In a lawsuit won by 

        SOFAR against the County, the court ruled the General Plan was missing 

        a mandatory Agriculture Element, and that Land-Use Designator Ag 20, covering 

        some 200,000 acres of private lands, was illegally zoned at 8-acre minimums. 

        A moratorium was placed on the affected land until the County brought 

        its General Plan into compliance with state law.</p>

      <p><strong>1993 Peninsular Mountain Range Symposium</strong>: Sponsored 

        by SOFAR, this conference brought together eminent scientists to publicly 

        discuss the geology, biology, history, and future on the Southern California 

        mountain range.</p>

      <p><strong>1993 Forest Conservation Initiative</strong>: Drafted by SOFAR 

        and approved by County voters, this initiative prevented small-lot subdivisions 

        within the Cleveland National Forest. It established a 40-acre minimum 

        parcel size that will protect the forest and wilderness.</p>

      <p><strong>1992 Central Mountain Community Plan</strong>: Successfully challenged 

        by SOFAR in court, the Community Plan was invalidated by a judicial ruling 

        supporting SOFAR&#8217;s claim that the provisions promoted development 

        in the backcountry were not properly evaluated. The County was ordered 

        to reevaluate the Plan and rewrite the Environmental Impact Report.<br>
