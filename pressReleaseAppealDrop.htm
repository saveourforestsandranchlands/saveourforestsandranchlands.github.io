            <p><strong>County Drops Appeal of Landmark Court Decision Regarding 

              200,000 acres in San Diego Backcountry</strong></p>

      <p>Board of Supervisors meets to rescind GPA 96-03 today, September 18, 

        2001 </p>

      <p>In dramatic confirmation of a recent finding by the Public Policy Institute 

        of California linking corruption in government with a failure to solve 

        regional growth problems, the County of San Diego has called an end to 

        its five-year campaign to illegally rezone 191,000 acres of rural lands 

        in San Diego's backcountry. Attorney's for the County notified representatives 

        for Save Our Forest And Ranchlands (SOFAR) that the San Diego County Board 

        of Supervisors has decided to abandon its legal challenge to a Superior 

        Court order issued last August which found the County's General Plan Amendment 

        (GPA) 96-03 in violation of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). 

      </p>

      <p>The case took on statewide and national attention when it drew the interest 

        of the Attorney General of the State of California and the Environmental 

        Protection Agency (EPA). In commenting on the County's action, the EPA 

        stated that &quot;the anticipated development will impact the quality 

        and quantity of the regions drinking water supply.&quot; The Attorney 

        General took the unusual step of filing an amicus brief in support of 

        SOFAR stating that &quot;The potential clearing and grading of vast amounts 

        of natural habitat in San Diego County without any further environmental 

        review will impair or destroy the state's biological resources, damaging 

        habitats utilized by numerous sensitive plant and animal species.&quot; 

      </p>

      <p>The County's decision to drop the appeal is clear and unprecedented admission 

        of wrongdoing which cost county taxpayers $2 million and creates, in the 

        midst of critical, long-range planning efforts like the County's 2020 

        General Plan Update and a new regional governance plan, a giant credibility 

        gap for the Board of Supervisors and the County Planning Department. Underlining 

        the significance of this case is the fact that the Superior Court in its 

        original ruling in 1996 placed a subdivision moratorium on the affected 

        lands, removing all permitting authority from the County and designating 

        SOFAR as interim land use authority. SOFAR has held this position for 

        five years. </p>

      <p>Joining SOFAR in friends of the court briefs were the California Attorney 

        General's office, San Diego Sierra Club, San Diego Audubon Society, California 

        Native Plant Society, Center for Biological Diversity, Surfrider Foundation, 

        San Diego Bay Keeper, California Oaks Foundation, Environmental Health 

        Coalition, and the Mountain Defense League. </p>
