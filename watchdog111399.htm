      <blockquote>A final victory was won for all San Diego activists by attorneys 

        for the Rural Heritage &amp; Watershed Initiative Committee as Judge Pate 

        of the Superior Court, in his final ruling issued last week for the Public 

        Records Act lawsuit, ordered additional redacted (edited) portions of 

        documents withheld by the County to be disclosed. </blockquote>

      <blockquote>Previously, the last group of documents consisting of communications 

        of aides to the Supervisors was ordered to be made public during a brief 

        trial on October 25, 1999. A previous document had been ordered by the 

        judge to be produced, and another group of documents was voluntarily disclosed 

        by County Counsel. Additionally, the court concluded that a memo of handwritten 

        notes by Supervisor Horn was not to be disclosed.</blockquote>
