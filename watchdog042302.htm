  	<TD><p><strong><u>Board of Supervisors Betrays the Public Good</u></strong></p>

      <blockquote>A &quot;Derelict Board.&quot; That's how the San Diego Union-Tribune 

        titled a lead editorial about the County's proposed plan to rezone 200,000 

        acres of agricultural preserve land and to eliminate an agricultural element 

        for the San Diego County General Plan. This of course, is the project 

        that SOFAR has been engaged with for many years now known as GPA 01-01 

        (formally GPA 96-03). The editorial went on to accuse the Board of deceiving 

        the public about the true nature of their project, which was quite simply 

        to ensure the development potential of the last of San Diego County's 

        resource lands. We could not agree more, both with the title and the content 

        of the editorial, which explains what Save Our Forest And Ranchlands and 

        its supporters have been fighting for all along. We need to keep fighting 

        for the sake of the lands in question and for the sake of all future planning 

        efforts.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>(If you did not see the editorial, we are enclosing the abstract. Please 

        email our office if you would like the full text)</blockquote>

      <blockquote>Derelict board | County keeps trying to develop farm land <br>

        The San Diego Union - Tribune; San Diego, Calif.; Apr 17, 2002; </blockquote>

      <blockquote>Abstract:<br>

        In 1996, Judge Judith McConnell found that the county's stewardship of 

        agricultural lands was so inept that she declared a building moratorium 

        and awarded land-use control of the 250,000 acres to SOFAR. Today, if 

        you live on that land and want to do a room addition, you apply to SOFAR 

        for a permit, not the county.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>Meanwhile, the methodology for gauging environmental impacts consists 

        of developing a theoretical, one-size-fits-all footprint for what a typical 

        residential home and lot might be, and dividing biological resources such 

        as endangered plants evenly among each theoretical lot. Then, county researchers 

        studied those theoretical lots to determine the impact of the agricultural 

        plan. Biology professors Ted Case of UCSD and Jay Diffendorfer of SDSU 

        called that approach &quot;so at odds with what we feel well-trained biologists 

        would perform that we can only conclude political or other influences 

        warped their methods.&quot;</blockquote>

      <p><strong><u>A Special Thank-You</u></strong></p>

      <blockquote>At the hearing on April 17th, our presentations went very well and covered 

        all of the topics involved in this project with expert testimony on the 

        law, planning, science, economics, and water quality. We were very fortunate 

        to have such a team on our side. </blockquote>

      <blockquote>Needless to say, the County met all of our facts with a torrent of deception. 

        We believe the County's misbehavior on this incredibly important item 

        underscores why we must and will continue to fight. The County plans to 

        go to court and have their plan accepted, and we intend to challenge the 

        validity of their plan. Thank you for your past and future support.</blockquote>

      <p><strong><u>A Special Congratulation</u></strong></p>

      <blockquote>SOFAR would like to congratulate past SOFAR Board member Suzanne Drolet. 

      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>She has just taken a trip to Chicago where she received the National 

        APA Transportation Planning Division's Annual Award for a Graduate Student 

        Research Paper. The paper looks at how San Diego has integrated transportation 

        and land use policies. Specific attention is paid to the City of San Diego 

        because it is such a significant part of the metropolitan area economically, 

      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>historically, in population and physical size, and has dedicated substantial 

        planning effort and financial support of transit based development. The 

        paper describes and evaluates efforts taken by the city to implement transit 

        based land use and then reflects on the direction of its General Plan 

        update within the context of the regional attempt to coordinate land use 

        decision making. </blockquote>
