      <p>Dear Harriet,</p>

      <p>The San Diego Union-Tribune editorial &quot;Derelict Board&quot; could 

        not have said it better when they wrote, &quot;the county keeps trying 

        to develop farmland.&quot; That is what Save Our Forest And Ranchlands 

        and our supporters have been saying all along about GPA 01-01 (formerly 

        known as GPA 96-03). That is also why for seven years we have prevented 

        the County from destroying 200,000 acres of farm and rangelands. </p>

      <p><strong>We must now continue in our fight to save San Diego's backcountry 

        against a &quot;Derelict Board&quot; of Supervisors. So we are once again 

        appealing for your help to raise funds to carry on SOFAR's work. </strong></p>

      <p>In the past, your support has given us the strength to be victorious 

        in this monumental struggle over the fate of the remaining rangelands 

        and wilderness of San Diego's mountain areas. With each victory we have 

        gained ground in both the political and environmental arena, while the 

        Board of Supervisors keep losing credibility as stewards of our land resources. 

      </p>

      <p><strong>In the battle over GPA 01-01, we accomplished three fundamental 

        changes: </strong> </p>

      <ul>

        <li>A grading ordinance that requires environmental review before any 

          clearing of the land<br>

        </li>

        <li> A minimum lot size increase on affected lands<br>

        </li>

        <li> Admission by the County that the real nature of this project is residential 

          use, not farming<br>

          At the beginning of GPA 01-01 six years ago, the County claimed that 

          100% of the land would be used for farming, and now after losing three 

          times in court the County is finally admitting that less than 3% of 

          the land will actually be used for agriculture. </li>

      </ul>

      <p>Throughout this battle, SOFAR's litigation has been based on the California 

        Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), and we have ridden this horse as far 

        as it can possibly take us. Because CEQA is primarily an informational 

        procedure and cannot force the county to make the fundamental policy changes 

        needed to protect our backcountry, our attorneys advised SOFAR to settle 

        this case. However, in another case SOFAR remains the court appointed 

        land-use authority on 50,000 acres of land in the Cleveland National Forest 

        and as author of the Forest Conservation Initiative stands guard over 

        forest resources. </p>

      <p><strong>It is now time for SOFAR to move on to different battlefields 

        to challenge our County's ever expanding sprawl policies. </strong></p>

      <p>We have retained the law firm of Shute, Mihaly, and Weinberger to comment 

        on the massive growth inducing impacts of the Imperial County water transfer 

        project. It is SOFAR's position that we must have a plan for the sustainable 

        use of our existing resources before we import additional resources that 

        would only be wasted by the current pattern of sprawl development. </p>

      <p>And as you know, the County of San Diego is currently updating its twenty-year-old 

        General Plan (2020 Plan). Significant changes in our land use laws are 

        being proposed. These changes will either chart the way to a healthy sustainable 

        future or they will fatally disable our last safeguards against a relentless 

        tide of sprawl development and traffic gridlock. </p>

      <p>Even while the County is moving forward with a so-called 2020 &quot;smart 

        growth&quot; plan, it continues to process hundreds of residential and 

        commercial projects. SOFAR is on guard. We are currently monitoring 90 

        major projects covering 30,000 acres. The growing list of outrageous projects 

        includes the development of a 500-acre economically viable avocado grove 

        in Lakeside for the construction of 200 unaffordable homes. We continue 

        to successfully oppose the East County Ralph's and Albertson's mega-stores, 

        while Von's has recently decided to jump into the ring with its version 

        of an Alpine strip-mall. Everybody is gambling on sprawl! </p>

      <p>The 2020 planning process is at a critical stage and the County's &quot;good 

        faith&quot; clearly cannot be relied upon. <strong>Therefore, we are now 

        asking you to join us in our fight to preserve not simply the health and 

        integrity of the wild open space in the backcountry, but their very existence. 

        </strong></p>

      <ul>

        <li><br>

          We must build on the momentum of our previous successful challenges 

          and create public recognition of what is at stake<br>

        </li>

        <li> We must prevent further loss of our agricultural and wildland resources<br>

        </li>

        <li> We must insist the county adopt a plan that protects the vital natural 

          resources and rural character that makes San Diego's backcountry a national 

          treasure<br>

        </li>

        <li> We must do all we can to urge the county to adopt well-defined urban 

          growth boundaries<br>

        </li>

        <li> The only way SOFAR will be able to accomplish these monumental goals 

          is with the help of supporters like you. Please consider making a contribution 

          to SOFAR today, so that we can continue to lead the charge to save San 

          Diego's backcountry. </li>

      </ul>

      <p><strong>Thank you for your past support and thank you for your contribution 

        now at this critical moment of need.</strong> </p>

      <p>Sincerely,<br>

        Duncan McFetridge; President<br>
