        <blockquote>The Board of Supervisors directed the Jacumba Valley Ranch 

          applicant to revise the Jacumba Valley Ranch project to include more 

          open space, to change the location of the hotel and water/sewer treatment 

          plant, and to add medical facilities for the congregate-care facility. 

          The project is expected to return before the Board at the end of August.</blockquote>

        <blockquote>This project would destroy 1,250 acres of farmland, several 

          hundred acres prime farmland, with 1,048 dwelling units, hotel, golf 

          course, congregate-care facility, and 108,000 square feet of commercial 

          space. The project is a prime example of urban sprawl and dwarfs the 

          tiny rural town of two hundred homes of Jacumba. SOFAR had a team of 

          experts that analyzed the project including an economics professor, 

          and an environmental law team and a planning expert experienced in CEQA. 

          They reached the conclusion that the project as planned should be denied.</blockquote>

        <blockquote>SOFAR’s “The Watchdog” would like to introduce a new feature. 

          Periodically, we will include editorials, columns, and articles from 

          journals that we think will be of interest to SOFAR Supporters. Today, 

          we are happy to include an editorial by Alexander Cockburn published 

          in the 19 June 2000 issue of “The Nation” titled “The End of Southern 

          California”. (link with Cockburn editorial under GPA 96-03). </blockquote>
