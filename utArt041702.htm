      <p><strong>Abstract:</strong><br>

        <em>Known as General Plan Amendment (GPA) 01-01 (formerly GPA 96- 03), 

        the county's plan has the distinction of having failed three times to 

        satisfy environmental impact reporting requirements of the California 

        Environmental Quality Act and has been condemned by community planning 

        groups, regional environmental groups, leading scientists and even the 

        state Attorney General's Office. In addition, the county has suffered 

        the humiliation of having its land use authority removed by the court 

        and a moratorium placed on the affected lands. For six years the county, 

        wasting millions of taxpayer dollars on flawed plans that supposedly protect 

        agriculture, has been unable to satisfy the court order. </em></p>

      <p><em>The fact is, the county has been trying to push sprawl development 

        in the name of agriculture with the consequence that its plan would virtually 

        eliminate farming and ranching. The plan would do so by rezoning these 

        lands for 10- and 40-acre parcels, increasing their development value 

        and paving the way for ranchette development of San Diego's last remaining 

        preserves. Gone with the ranches and farms would be a $15 million public 

        investment made to preserve them under the Williamson Act, a 1965 program 

        which lowered the property taxes on farmers and ranchers who agreed to 

        maintain their land in lot sizes large enough to support ranch and farmland 

        use. </em></p>

      <p>`When a city such as San Diego considers planning and zoning for a community, 

        it doesn't just ask landowners and builders what they want. Cities consider 

        what's best for the entire community, including impacts on traffic, the 

        environment, quality of life and character of neighborhoods.&quot; </p>

      <p>So stated a San Diego Union-Tribune editorial last year in response to 

        a misguided effort by the county of San Diego to rezone 191,000 acres 

        of agricultural, ranch and wildlands within the original boundaries of 

        the Cleveland National Forest that scientists believe will have negative 

        impacts far greater than those envisioned by county planners. </p>

      <p>Known as General Plan Amendment (GPA) 01-01 (formerly GPA 96- 03), the 

        county's plan has the distinction of having failed three times to satisfy 

        environmental impact reporting requirements of the California Environmental 

        Quality Act and has been condemned by community planning groups, regional 

        environmental groups, leading scientists and even the state Attorney General's 

        Office. In addition, the county has suffered the humiliation of having 

        its land use authority removed by the court and a moratorium placed on 

        the affected lands. For six years the county, wasting millions of taxpayer 

        dollars on flawed plans that supposedly protect agriculture, has been 

        unable to satisfy the court order. </p>

      <p>County planners have promoted its new plan as one that would &quot;save 

        agriculture&quot; in the backcountry. If this is true, why did the building 

        industry protest the moratorium stating that, &quot;a building moratorium 

        on agricultural lands would have a chilling effect on the building industry.&quot; 

      </p>

      <p>The fact is, the county has been trying to push sprawl development in 

        the name of agriculture with the consequence that its plan would virtually 

        eliminate farming and ranching. The plan would do so by rezoning these 

        lands for 10- and 40-acre parcels, increasing their development value 

        and paving the way for ranchette development of San Diego's last remaining 

        preserves. Gone with the ranches and farms would be a $15 million public 

        investment made to preserve them under the Williamson Act, a 1965 program 

        which lowered the property taxes on farmers and ranchers who agreed to 

        maintain their land in lot sizes large enough to support ranch and farmland 

        use. </p>

      <p>In addition to the loss of ranches and farms and the public money spent 

        to save them, gone are the thousands of acres of watershed. This watershed 

        feeds local reservoirs and is key to protecting the quality of local water 

        supplies. </p>

      <p>Wildlife also would suffer, in some cases fatally, as a network of roads 

        and fences severes the vital habitat corridors of mountain lions and other 

        species. World famous biologist Michael Soule said of the county's plan: 

        &quot;&quot;wildlife would virtually disappear&quot; on the farm and rangelands 

        of San Diego's backcountry. </p>

      <p>Just when the region is desperately trying to solve its housing, water, 

        traffic and infrastructure crises, the county's project adds insult to 

        injury. How can the county justify having taxpayers fund infrastructure 

        for million-dollar ranchette estates in the backcountry when the majority 

        of San Diegans can't even buy their own home? </p>

      <p>With so many shortcomings and so much opposition, one might expect someone 

        on the Board of Supervisors to have demonstrated a modicum of leadership 

        and common sense by withdrawing the plan and pledging an end to its groundless 

        legal defenses that have cost county taxpayers millions of dollars. But 

        as is so often the case in San Diego, the right thing is never the easy 

        thing to do. Last month the county Planning Commission voted 4-2 to recommend 

        approval of the plan by the Board of Supervisors this month, declaring 

        that, in the view of the commissioners, the environmental reporting problems 

        had been resolved. </p>

      <p>The American Institute of Architects and the Design Council believe that 

        to move forward with a land-use plan as fatally flawed as this one before 

        the county completes its 2020 General Plan Update would be a big mistake. 

        If adopted by the board, this amendment to the plan will undermine recent 

        efforts to encourage the rebuilding of our urban cores and create a huge 

        new demand for public infrastructure at a time when local municipalities 

        are desperate to find funding for urgently needed reinvestment. Adoption 

        of this would be both a legal failure and a land-use failure, possibly 

        the worst examples of both to date, given the plan's long list of bad 

        reviews. </p>

      <p>It's time for the supervisors to take the business of land-use planning 

        in the backcountry seriously and reject this amendment. If the supervisors 

        are serious about smart growth and regional planning, they have an opportunity 

        to support an alternative that protects San Diego's watershed, wilderness 

        and rangelands. </p>

      <p>What's at stake is too important to leave to the ingenuity of builders 

        and private landowners. After all, &quot;The noblest motive is the public 

        good.&quot; </p>
