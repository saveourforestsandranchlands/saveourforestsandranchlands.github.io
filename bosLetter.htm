      <p>Re: GP 2020</p>

      <p>Dear Board of Supervisors, </p>

      <p>Save Our Forest And Ranchlands (SOFAR) is a grass-roots organization 

        dedicated to the protection of the wilderness, watershed, agricultural, 

        and scenic resources of San Diego County. We are comprised of concerned 

        citizens and experts in the fields of land use, conservation of natural 

        resources, land planning, and biology. In the past, we have submitted 

        detailed comments on the GP 2020 planning process, and, again, reiterate 

        our profound concern regarding the foundation of GP 2020 and the direction 

        in which it is headed. </p>

      <p>The County's so-called GP 2020 is based on the idea of accepting its 

        share of a projected region-wide population increase. The County calls 

        this density-based planning. This is a theoretical misstep. We have said 

        before that a proper General Plan should be based on the sustainable use 

        of finite resources, including both built and natural resources. These 

        resources constitute the foundation of our regional community. The sustainable 

        use of these resources is vital to the long term health and welfare of 

        the region. Heretofore, such resources have been privatized and exploited 

        in a non-sustainable way for the profit of a few. This must change. Planning 

        for these foundational resources must be for the common good of all citizens.</p>

      <p>The San Diego region is experiencing five structural crises in housing, 

        transportation, beach pollution, infrastructure, and the environment. 

        All these crises have the same root cause: inefficient, wasteful land-use 

        planning. The question is not how to equitably distribute more people 

        throughout a system that is dysfunctional and structurally failing, but 

        rather how to best refurbish and redesign our built resources and protect 

        our natural ones. Cities of comparable size with better urban design and 

        transportation facilities have proven themselves capable of accommodating 

        much higher densities and maintaining their quality of life.</p>

      <p>Planners and the public agree (see Public Policy Institute survey) that 

        the answer is an urban growth boundary. This line would clearly demarcate 

        the built from the natural resources. Inside the boundary would be our 

        urban areas. These areas are where our tax dollars should be redirected 

        to encourage housing, improve traffic, clean up beach pollution, rebuild 

        infrastructure, and protect the environment. Outside the boundary would 

        be our farmland, open space, and wilderness areas. These are to be preserved. 

      </p>

      <p>The cities should be the areas to incorporate the bulk of the projected 

        increase in population, not the outlying unincorporated County. The County 

        should not be in the development business. It should act as guardians 

        of the farmlands, rangelands, and open space of the backcountry as well 

        as provide stewardship over our Country Towns. Only through implementing 

        an urban growth boundary can we reinvest in our cities to make them attractive 

        and vibrant places to live and work. At the same time, we can protect 

        and preserve our agricultural and open space lands. First, protect the 

        resources, then distribute the population, and separate one from the other 

        with an urban growth boundary.</p>

      <p><br>

        Sincerely,</p>

      <p><br>

        President<br>
