      In his APA article, Mr. Shigley does an admirable job of summarizing
      California's valiant efforts to solve one of the most threatening
      environmental problems of our age.  Unfortunately, however, he has
      chosen the worst example possible to illustrate how the landmark
      legislation SB375 might be implemented.  In fact, SANDAG in San Diego
      County has steadfastly ignored the threat of climate change, and
      squandered opportunities to lead the way in supporting public
      transportation in Southern California.

				Mr. Shigley accurately describes the California Attorney General's
				strong leadership in instigating legal and pre-legal settlements
				with public entities who flout climate change warnings.
				Remarkably, however, Shigley fails to mention that SANDAG was
				actually the subject of such pre-litigation discussions with both
				the

				<a href="#bottom"><sup>iii</sup></a> , the
				Affordable Housing Coalition, and The Transit-Riders Alliance.
				In fact, at the conclusion of those discussions, SANDAG signed a
				<a target="_blank" href="pdf/SANDAG_SOFAR_Settlement2.pdf">settlement agreement</a>
				<a href="#bottom"><sup>iv</sup></a>
				for the precise purpose of mitigating the
				enormous climate change impacts expected to result from its
				flawed transportation planning; as the AG and SOFAR had pointed
				out, SANDAG’s Regional Transportation Plan serves to promote
				urban sprawl in San Diego County’s rural areas and to encourage
				a transportation system committed to the automobile.

				Mr. Shigley also fails to mention that SANDAG’s poor transit

				<a target="_blank" href="http://www.sandag.org/uploads/publicationid/publicationid_1274_6239.pdf">ITPR</a>
				<a href="#bottom"><sup>v</sup></a>
				, a scathing report by a
				national team of transit experts, including Robert Cevero, who
				was  mentioned  in Shigley's article.   The Attorney General
				specifically cited this report in its strong critique of

				SANDAG itself has conceded that implementation of its Regional
				Transportation Plan will lead to the destruction of agricultural
				lands, the long-term degradation of air quality and water and
				biological resources, and long term impacts from increased
				energy use in San Diego County.  Tellingly, the agency’s approval
				of the RTP included a Statement of
				<a target="_blank" href="pdf/Statement_of_Overiding_Considerations.pdf">
				Overriding Considerations</a>
				<a href="#bottom"><sup>vii</sup></a>,
				which attempted to argue that these impacts could be justified
				for the sake of the economy.   Yet, it is the economy of
				unsustainable development that SANDAG is promoting with its so-called
				200 “smart growth centers.”  (See map at p.13 of APA story article.)
				Randomly tossing 200 developments into a "sea of automobiles" is
				like "casting pearls before swine"   In fact, such haphazard planning
				is exactly the opposite of Cervero's concept of a "string of pearls,"
				or transit-based city centers connected by rail.  Importantly, the
				ITPR points out that San Diego County could easily meet all its
				growth demands if it built such transit-based centers (p.33)

				Instead of encouraging city-centered growth, the SANDAG plan,
				by its own accounting, promotes excessive growth in rural areas.
				The population in unincorporated San Diego County is projected to
				grow by 55%, and by an average of 42% in three rural communities,
				over the next 20 years.   Freeway lane miles will increase by
				over 800 miles, leading to a 38.8 million increase in daily
				vehicle-miles traveled, or VMT;    Gasoline consumption will
				increase by 31.26%, diesel consumption by 25%.   To top it off,
				greenhouse gas emissions under the RTP will exceed existing levels
				by about 31%, or 5.3 million tons of CO2 per year.  The
				<a target="_blank" href="http://www.sandag.org/programs/transportation/comprehensive_transportation_projects/2030rtp/2007eir_final.pdf">
				Environmental Impact Report (EIR)</a>

				for the RTP finds that this
				increase in GHG emissions will contribute to the exacerbation of
				climate change, and concludes this impact to be significant. Id.

				In sum, while California and its Attorney General have led the
				way in our nation’s fight to control global warming, SANDAG has
				not shown similar leadership in San Diego.  It was only through
				threat of  litigation and a key settlement agreement that San
				Diego County has  even a remote chance to build

				Mr. Shigley does a serious disservice by leaving out the
				"inconvenient truths" behind SANDAG’s plan.
