    <TD> <p align="center"><em>Save Our Forest And Ranchlands (SOFAR) requests 

        your group's support for SOFAR's recommendation for General Plan Amendment 

        (GPA) 96-03:</em> </p>

      <p>1. The County of San Diego adopt an Agriculture Element to our General 

        Plan to cover several hundred thousand acres of irrigated cropland west 

        of the County Water Authority (CWA) infrastructure line. </p>

      <p>2. Adopt lot size minimums for Agriculture Preserve (Ag 20) farmlands 

        and open space of 80 acres east of the CWA infrastructure line, 40 acres 

        west of the CWA line, and 10 acres for prime farmland west of the CWA 

        line.</p>

      <p>3. Environmental review to take place for clearing or subdivision of 

        land. </p>

      <p><strong>BACKGROUND: </strong></p>

      <p><br>

        The County&#8217;s project, GPA 96-03, is the response to SOFAR&#8217;s 

        lawsuit against the County for not adopting an Agriculture Element and 

        not properly zoning our Agricultural Preserve lands. The Superior Court 

        ruled that the General Plan was missing a mandatory Agriculture Element 

        and the urban zoning of 8-acre minimum lot size set by the County for 

        Agricultural Preserve (Ag 20) lands was illegal. All subdivision activity 

        and issuance of building permits was stopped.</p>

      <p><br>

        GPA 96-03, as proposed by the County, allows 10-acre minimum lot sizes 

        for Ag 20 lands west of the CWA infrastructure line. Ag 20 lands east 

        of the CWA infrastructure line would have a 40-acre minimum lot size or 

        a 10-acre minimum lot size if it can be demonstrated that there is evidence 

        of adequate soils, topography, and water availability to support the proposed 

        agriculture. </p>

      <p><br>

        The County&#8217;s own Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for GPA 96-03 

        assumes complete clearing of the 200,000 acres of Agricultural Preserve 

        (Ag 20) farmlands. This would have tremendous negative ramifications on 

        San Diego County&#8217;s watersheds, especially those that fill our largest 

        reservoirs: El Capitan, San Vicente, and Lake Hodges. </p>

      <p><br>

        <strong>Unmitigated significant impacts due to GPA 96-03 are: </strong></p>

      <p><strong>Transportation/Circulation</strong> &#8211; The project could 

        significantly impact approximately 39 road miles.</p>

      <p></p>

      <p><strong>Biological Resources</strong> &#8211; Some sensitive biological 

        resources could be significantly impacted by the project. </p>

      <p><br>

        <strong>Water Resources</strong> &#8211; Could deplete groundwater in 

        areas that are groundwater limited and result in significant water quality 

        impacts from fertilizer application. </p>

      <p><br>

        <strong>Visual Quality/Aesthetics</strong> &#8211; Change in landform 

        alteration from grading and clearing could result in significant visual 

        quality impacts. </p>

      <p><br>

        <strong>Cultural/Paleontological</strong> &#8211; Significant impacts 

        could occur due to grading and clearing. </p>

      <p><br>

        <strong>Noise</strong> &#8211; Future non-discretionary uses and traffic 

        could cause significant noise impacts. </p>

      <p><br>

        <strong>Air Quality</strong> - Could result in increased inhalable particulate 

        matter. </p>

      <p><br>

        <strong>Geological Resources</strong> &#8211; Grading and landform modification 

        could increase the potential for impacts related to flooding, erosion, 

        siltation, and unstable soils. </p>

      <p><br>

        This assumption of complete clearing of the backcountry is not done to 

        facilitate agriculture; this is a masquerade for the complete development 

        of San Diego&#8217;s backcountry. The lot size minimums proposed by the 

        County will not support SOFAR recommends a more realistic alternative 

        GPA 96-03 that would meet the requirements of the Williamson Act, would 

        promote sustainable agriculture, would meet the project&#8217;s objectives, 

        and that would protect Ag 20 lands from inappropriate development. This 

        alternative would designate all Ag 20 lands west of the CWA infrastructure 

        line at a 40-acre minimum lot size. This is the minimum size needed to 

        enter a Williamson Act contract. Any Ag 20 land west of the CWA line that 

        is prime farmland as defined under the Act, would be 10-acre minimum lot 

        size. This is the minimum size for prime farmland for a Williamson Act 

        contract. All Ag 20 lands east of the CWA infrastructure line would be 

        80-acre minimum lot size. This is the minimum size for grazing lands to 

        enter into a Williamson Act contract. By the County&#8217;s own evaluation, 

        these backcountry ranchlands, dependent on limited groundwater, are suited 

        for grazing. </p>

        Seven conservation groups have endorsed the SOFAR Alternative to GPA 96-03: 

        the Sierra Club, Buena Vista &amp; Palomar Audubon Societies, Backcountry 

        Coalition, Preserve Wild Santee, Save South Bay, Volcan Mountain Preserve 

        Foundation, and Friends of Julian. The Ramona, Crest/Dehesa, and Boulevard 

        Planning/Sponsor Groups have endorsed our alternative. Please join us 

        in recommending to the County that they adopt SOFAR&#8217;s Alternative 

        to GPA 96-03.</p></TD>
