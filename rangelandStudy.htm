      <p>Dear Mr. McFetridge</p>
      <p>I have been researching, teaching, and advising about range management 
        in California since 1989, and previous to that, wrote my dissertation 
        on grazing in the central Sierra Nevada. I have served as the President 
        of the California Section of the Society of Range Management, am on the 
        Editorial Board of Rangelands Magazine, and am a frequent reviewer and 
        contributor for the Journal of Range Management. I am an associate editor 
        for California Agriculture, and am Associate Professor in the Department 
        of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management at the University of 
        California, Berkeley. I am a Certified Rangeland Manager. With my students, 
        I have published a number of articles about rangeland ecology, conservation, 
        and management in California, some of them statewide in scope.</p>
      <p>Last week you asked that I review Central San Diego county&#8217;s (20) 
        designated areas, looking at their productivity as rangelands. I have 
        done so, working with my graduate student, Peter Hopkinson. Peter is a 
        PhD Candidate working on a dissertation on native grass ecology. We used 
        a variety of publications and the soil survey (SCS and USDA 1973) to review 
        rangeland productivity and use in this region. We looked most closely 
        at the larger (20) designated areas in the planning areas, including two 
        areas in Ramona, three in Pala Pauma, the Santa Ysabel Valley in North 
        Mountain and Julian, and the large (20) designated area in Desert SRA.</p>
      <p>Please note that a summary of our findings concludes this letter.</p>
      <p><strong>Rangelands</strong></p>
      <p> Rangelands are defined as lands that are unsuitable for crop or timber 
        production. Worldwide, they are generally too dry, too high, too unpredictable, 
        too steep, or with soils too shallow or rocky for other agricultural uses. 
        Much of central San Diego county fits this definition, and the original 
        European settlers were those who knew how to use the land for extensive 
        livestock production. Land grants in the nineteenth century acknowledged 
        the extensive nature of the industry, and usually consisted of more than 
        a thousand acres. While there is no absolute definition of how many livestock 
        are required to support a family ranching operation, it is generally estimated 
        at about 200-300 brood cows for a cow-calf operation of the type typical 
        of California (Holechek et al. 1995). Most often, income from livestock 
        is part rather than all of household income. Concurrent crop production, 
        off-farm income, and hunting leases are among the sources of income that 
        have been identified as making up the rest (Huntsinger et al.1997, Bartlett 
        et al. 1989, Richards and George 1996, Johnson 1998, Hargreave 1993). 
        Ranching, however, is considered an important part of personal and family 
        identity for those with range livestock (Richards and George 1996).</p>
      <p>The forage production of the rangelands of central San Diego County is 
        based on the annual grasses that flourish in the Mediterranean, wet winter 
        climate. They grow rapidly when water is available and temperatures are 
        warm in the late winter and early Spring, setting abundant seed in the 
        late Spring that germinates with sufficient fall rain. Extensive livestock 
        production must cope with highly variable, rainfall dependent annual production, 
        and long, dry summers. Palatable shrubs, moist meadows and swales, upland 
        pastures with cooler climates, desert pastures, and the feeding of hay, 
        agricultural byproducts, supplements and other forages helps to smooth 
        the unpredictability in climate, and to carry herds through the dry periods. 
        Herds can be moved in and out of the county to take advantage of pastures 
        in other areas at certain times of the year; stocker grazing operations, 
        where young cattle are purchased every year to take advantage of the winter 
        and spring feed, and then sold when the forage is gone, are also a common 
        strategy for utilizing this type of rangeland.</p>
      <p>Rangeland grazing generally requires relatively large acreages that provide 
        forage and habitat diversity, as the palatability and quality of different 
        species and vegetation types varies at different times of year. Range 
        livestock, unlike closely confined domestic animals and crops, can move 
        themselves to obtain water and therefore discrete, fairly widely dispersed 
        water sources are adequate for extensive range grazing. While of relatively 
        low value on a per acre basis, extensive production also requires relatively 
        low investment per acre, and of the various crops that can be produced 
        on San Diego&#8217;s rangelands, requires the least disturbance of biota 
        and soils. Of course, an individual producer may make the decision to 
        utilize more aggressive techniques. Typical modifications that may be 
        part of a range livestock production program include development of reliable 
        water sources, interseeding with legumes and pasture grasses, and removal 
        or thinning of brush or dense oaks. In recent decades, removal of oaks 
        by livestock producers (once encouraged and even subsidized by the state) 
        has declined significantly in California (Huntsinger et al. 1997) as ranchers 
        have become aware of the value of oaks to forage production (Frost and 
        McDougald 1989), and for wildlife and amenity values.</p>
      <p>That is not to say that rangeland grazing does not have impacts on the 
        biota and soils. Like any agricultural endeavor, grazing can cause changes 
        in species composition, soil stability, and water quality. However, these 
        impacts can be controlled and minimized with appropriate management practices. 
      </p>
      <p><strong>Central San Diego County Rangelands</strong> </p>
      <p>The (20) designated rangelands we examined are of productivities typical 
        of southern California rangelands (McDougald et al. 1991). These lands 
        have been used for rangeland grazing for more than a hundred years (Burcham 
        1981[1957]). Livestock production and production practices have shaped 
        the present Central San Diego landscape of chaparral slopes, and grassy 
        oak and grassland valleys with wide open vistas and a very natural appearance. 
        Generations of San Diegans have enjoyed this landscape, often without 
        even being aware of its agricultural function. Wildlife and watershed 
        values have to a great extent been retained. Extensive livestock production 
        requires relatively large acreages, but makes use of a wide variety of 
        lands, including open chaparral, woodlands, scrublands, meadows and upland 
        grasslands. This variety is also part of extensive livestock production, 
        where the goal is to carry livestock through the year (or part of the 
        year in the case of some systems) using as little expensive feed as possible. 
        Vegetation types and localities of different climate complement each other. 
        Ideally, the livestock producer has access to a mix of climatic and vegetation 
        types that provide feed during different times of the year. Sometimes, 
        part of that menu is public rangeland. Sometimes, it is land leased from 
        other people.</p>
      <p>The herbaceous component of Central San Diegan rangelands is mostly annual 
        grasses, with varying proportions of native needlegrass and other perennial 
        grasses. Much of the range is chaparral intermingled with open grassland 
        and woodland grass. At higher elevations, woodland grass and chaparral 
        are intermingled with broadleaf and coniferous trees. Grading into the 
        desert to the east are semidesert shrubs, annual grasses and broadleaf 
        herbs, and perennial grasses such as desert needlegrass. Moist meadows 
        and swales, though small, are highly productive often even through the 
        summer, and are an important complement to the surrounding dry range in 
        an extensive grazing system. USDA Forest Service analysis of some of the 
        meadows in the Area (20) designated lands reveals exceptionally high productivities 
        four to five times that of upland range.</p>
      <p>The NRCS (cite) identifies four major climatic zones for rangeland in 
        San Diego county, all of which are found in the areas under consideration: 
        1. the Southern California Coastal Plains (Pala-Pauma and Ramona), 2. 
        the western part of the Southern California mountains (North Mountain 
        and Julian), 3. The eastern part of the Southern California mountains 
        (minimally present), and 4. the Sonoran basin and range (Desert SRA). 
        Cooler air and fog make the Southern California Coastal Plains climate 
        more moderate, higher elevations result in cooler temperatures and higher 
        rainfall in the western Southern California Mountains, and the Sonoran 
        Basin and Range is characterized by very low rainfall and very high summer 
        temperatures. These factors affect the quality and temporal distribution 
        of forage production at each site. We will discuss the rangeland characteristics 
        of larger (20) designated areas in five planning areas: Pala Pauma, Ramona, 
        Julian, North Mountain, and Desert SRA. It should be noted that this is 
        not an all-inclusive analysis. Mapped soil types most common in each study 
        area are examined. More precise information could be obtained through 
        the use of GIS data layers and technology available to the county.</p>
      <p><u>Pala-Pauma Planning Area</u></p>
      <p>Vegetation types within the Pala Pauma (20) designated areas of more 
        than 1000 acres that are typically used for grazing include Englemann 
        and coast live oak woodlands, annual and perennial grasslands, mixed chaparral, 
        and coastal sage scrub. Statewide, extensive livestock grazing is the 
        most common agricultural use of oak woodland, grassland, and chaparral 
        or scrub lands (Ewing et al. 1988).</p>
      <p>The predominant soils in the Pala-Pauma (20) areas fall into two "Range 
        Sites" described by the NRCS and termed "Loamy Range Site 
        19" and "Shallow Loamy Range Site 19" by the NRCS (SCS 
        and USDA Forest Service, 1973), with the former the most common. Range 
        Sites are defined for a geographical area by a combination of soil, slope, 
        and climatic characteristics that produce specific vegetation and forage 
        types. Range sites do not include land considered unsuitable for grazing 
        by the Natural Resource Conservation Service: for example, areas with 
        such abundant rocky outcrops that they prevent animal access or produce 
        no forage. These two Range Sites do not include all the lands in these 
        (20) areas: small pockets of differing soils are no doubt present. Narrow 
        or small riparian areas are present and augment productivity, but are 
        not reflected in these production figures. This is, rather, the dryland 
        range typical of the area.</p>
      <p>Annual forage produced on rangelands for livestock grazing is generally 
        presented in pounds per acre. Monitoring of productivity over years provides 
        typical forage production for various range sites in low rainfall and 
        high rainfall years. It is general practice in California to plan for 
        somewhere in between. The pounds per acre produced on a range site is 
        then modified by the amount that can be grazed by livestock without damaging 
        soils or plant productivity. This results in "Available" forage, 
        which is forage available for grazing on a sustainable basis. Finally, 
        this is converted to "AUMs", Animal-Unit-Months. AUMs are 
        the amount of forage needed to support one breeding cow for one month. 
        Horses require a bit more than one AUM, sheep .20 AUM. </p>
      <p>As has been earlier described, AUMs on private rangeland are typically 
        supplemented by feed, public range, wet meadows or pasture, agricultural 
        by products, supplements and so forth. For example, Forest Service grazing 
        leases are often for 2-3 months of the year in the summer. During the 
        rest of the year, the herd is carried on private ground, other leased 
        pasture, feed and so forth. Two hundred leased AUMs on Forest Service 
        land may typically be supporting one hundred head for part of the year. 
        Sometimes, this is a part of the year when other options are limited or 
        expensive.</p>
      <p>Annual productivity for the two Range Sites is presented in the following 
        table (SCS 1973):</p>

      <p>Available forage productivity can be affected also by increases in unpalatable 
        species, or dense trees and shrubs. Low densities of trees&#8212;for example 
        the open oak savanna found in central San Diego County &#8211; may result 
        in greater than expected forage production or better temporal distribution 
        of forage quality (Frost and McDougald 1989). Some shrubs are also grazed 
        by livestock and can be used, particularly during times of the year when 
        the grass is dry. General descriptions of the two major range types in 
        this area follow (SCS and USDA 1973):</p>
      <blockquote>Loamy Range 19: The topography of this type of site ranges from gently 
        sloping to very steep. Soils are coarse sandy loams, sandy loams, very 
        fine sandy loams, and loams that are moderately deep to very deep over 
        bedrock. All are moderately to somewhat excessively well drained. Cover 
        is generally grass and shrubs or grass. About half the cover may be ceanothus, 
        California sagebrush, sumac, chamise, flattop buckwheat, black sage and 
        other shrubs, and the rest is soft chess, wild oats, filaree, needlegrass, 
        and other annual grasses and plants. In many areas, removal of brush can 
        increase forage yields by two to four times (SCS and USDA, 1973).</blockquote>
      <blockquote>Shallow Loamy Range 19: The topography of this site is moderately sloping 
        to very steep. Soils are eroded coarse sandy loams to loams that are shallow 
        and very shallow over igneous rock or sandstone. They are rocky or stony 
        in many places, and well drained to somewhat excessively drained. The 
        site has brush cover, mostly of chamise or flattop buckwheat and California 
        sagebrush along with small amounts of sumac, ceanothus, and other species 
        of chaparral. The herbaceous plant cover is a mixture of soft chess, wild 
        oaks, filaree, and other annual and perennial grasses and plants. </blockquote>
      <p>Our examination of the more common soil types found in this area indicate 
        that most of them fall into NRCS "capability groupings" that 
        indicate severe limitations for agricultural use. In almost every case, 
        NRCS recommends limiting their use to pasture, range, woodland, or wildlife 
        habitat. </p>
      <p><strong>Ramona</strong></p>
      <p> Vegetation types within the Ramona (20) designated areas of more than 
        1000 acres (Draft EIR) that are typically used for grazing include coastal 
        sage scrub, open chaparral, annual grasslands, and open coast live and 
        Englemann oak woodlands . Statewide, extensive livestock grazing is the 
        most common agricultural use of oak woodland, grassland, and chaparral 
        or scrub lands.</p>
      <p>The predominant soils in the Ramona (20) designated areas fall into Range 
        Sites described by the NRCS as "Loamy Range Sites 19 and 20W" 
        and "Shallow Loamy Range Sites 19 and 20W, Claypan 19, and Granitic 
        20W and 20E " by the NRCS (SCS and USDA Forest Service, 1973). Range 
        sites do not include land considered unsuitable for grazing by the Natural 
        Resource Conservation Service: for example, areas with such abundant rocky 
        outcrops that they prevent animal access or produce no forage. These two 
        Range Sites do not include all the lands in these (20) areas: small pockets 
        of differing soils are no doubt present. Narrow or small riparian areas 
        are present and augment productivity, but are not reflected in these production 
        figures. This is, rather, the dryland range typical of the area.</p>
      <p>Annual productivity for typical range sites in the Ramona planning area 
        is presented in the following table[1]:</p>

      <p>General descriptions of typical range types in this area follow (SCS 
        and USDA 1973):</p>
      <blockquote>Loamy and Shallow Loamy 19: see "Pala Pauma" above.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>Shallow Loamy 20E: The topography is moderately sloping to very steep, 
        and soils are eroded coarse sandy loams that are shallow to very shallow 
        over igneous rock or sandstone, and rocky in many places. They are excessively 
        drained. The site typically has an open cover of brush consisting of chamise, 
        manzanita, desert ceanothus, red shank, flattop buckwheat, and some elmbrush. 
        Annual grasses, needlegrass, and filaree are typical. </blockquote>
      <blockquote>Shallow Loamy 20W: Similar to Shallow Loamy 20E, above, but more productive. 
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>Loamy 20W: The topography is genetly sloping to very steep, and soils 
        are coarse sandy loams, fine sandy loams, sandy loams, and loams that 
        are mostly moderately deep to very deep. All are well to excessively well 
        drained. The site has an open grass or woodland grass cover and scattered 
        to common oaks. At high elevations, there is a mix of oaks and Jeffrey 
        pine. Wildoats, needlegrasses, soft chess, filaree, burclover, as well 
        as bromegrasses and fescues, are typical. Fertilization, brush control, 
        and seeding are appropriate on many of the soils characteristic of this 
        site.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>Claypan 19: The topography is gently sloping to moderately steep. Soils 
        are loams, sandy loams, and loamy fine sands that have a clay, sandy clay, 
        or clay loam subsoil. They are shallow to mocerately deep over bedrock. 
        This site has an open cover of grass and scattered flattop buckwheat and 
        California sagebrush. Wildoats, needlegrasses, soft chess, filaree, burclover, 
        as well as bromegrasses and fescues are typical. </blockquote>
      <blockquote>Granitic 20W: The topography is moderately sloping to very steep. Soils 
        are loamy coarse sands and in most places are rocky, and shallow to moderately 
        deep over weathered granitic bedrock. The site has an open to dense cover 
        of brush and scattered oak trees. Scrub oak, elmbrush, red shank, ceanothus, 
        and other chaparral shrubs, and small amounts of big sagebrush and flattop 
        buckwheat, are typical. Usual grasses include wild oats, soft chess, filaree, 
        brome, needlegrass, and fescue. </blockquote>
      <blockquote>Granitic 20E: Similar to Granitic 20W in topography and soils. Rock outcrops 
        are common but not numerous enough to impede the movement of livestock 
        or decrease forage production. The site has an open cover of brush and 
        some California juniper. Elmbrush, desert ceanothus, desert needlegrass, 
        and other perennial grasses and filaree are typical, as is brome, cheatgrass, 
        and other shrubs.</blockquote>
      <p>Our examination of predominant soil types found in these (20) areas indicate 
        that most of them fall into NRCS "capability groupings" that 
        indicate severe limitations for agricultural use. Almost exclusively, 
        NRCS recommends limiting their use to pasture, range, woodland, or wildlife 
        habitat.</p>
      <p><strong>North Mountain and Julian</strong></p>
      <p> Vegetation types within the North Mountain and Julian (20) areas of 
        more than 1000 acres (Draft EIR) that are typically used for grazing include 
        open chaparral and scrub types, grassland, open Englemann, coast live, 
        and mixed oak woodlands, acacia scrublands, grasslands, and open mixed 
        oak-conifer woodlands. Statewide, extensive livestock grazing is the most 
        common agricultural use of oak woodland, grassland, and chaparral or scrub 
        lands.</p>
      <p>The predominant soils in the North Mountain and Julian (20) areas fall 
        into Range Sites described by the NRCS in the North Mountain and Julian 
        (20) areas as "Granitic 20W and 20E, Sandy 30, Loamy 20W and 20E, 
        and Loamy 30" by the NRCS (SCS and USDA Forest Service, 1973). Range 
        Sites are defined for a geographical area by a combination of soil, slope, 
        and climatic characteristics that produce specific vegetation and forage 
        types. Range sites do not include land considered unsuitable for grazing 
        by the Natural Resource Conservation Service: for example, areas with 
        such abundant rocky outcrops that they prevent animal access or produce 
        no forage. These two Range Sites do not include all the lands in these 
        (20) areas: small pockets of differing soils are no doubt present. Narrow 
        or small riparian areas are present and augment productivity, but are 
        not reflected in these production figures. This is, rather, the dryland 
        range typical of the area.</p>

      <p>Our examination of predominant soil types found in these (20) areas indicate 
        that most of them fall into NRCS "capability groupings" that

        NRCS recommends limiting their use to pasture, range, woodland, or wildlife 
        habitat.</p>
      <p>Typical Southern Californian grasslands have expected productivities 
        of .1 to .7 Animal Unit Months depending on slope and canopy, with a maximum 
        tree or shrub canopy cover of less than 50% (McDougald et al. 1991). The 
        soils of the (20) designated areas are quite productive by this standard. 
        Even in the case of Alkali Flats 30, though the productivity is lower, 
        it consists of vitally important shrubs for desert rangeland use. </p>
      <p><strong>Ancillary Benefits</strong></p>
      <p> Although the primary purpose of the (20) land use designation is to 
        facilitate extensive agricultural use of the land, the protection of extensive 
        agriculture, especially rangeland grazing, can also produce substantial 
        additional public benefits. Grassland and oak woodland, the vegetation 
        types whose highest and best sustainable use is livestock grazing, also 
        provide some of the state&#8217;s best wildlife habitat, protect watersheds, 
        and furnish visual amenities. In contrast, intensive agriculture of the 
        sort envisioned for (20) designated land in General Plan Amendment GPA 
        96-03 does not provide these ancillary public benefits at levels anywhere 
        near those of grazing land. Intensive agriculture also results in much 
        greater soil and vegetation disturbance than rangeland grazing.</p>
      <p>The California Wildlife-Habitat Relationship (WHR) System, maintained 
        by the California Department of Fish and Game, is the state&#8217;s most 
        comprehensive wildlife-habitat analysis tool. Using the WHR classification 
        of habitat types, the WHR system produces lists of wildlife species associated 
        with particular vegetation types (Meyer and Laudenslayer 1988). San Diego 
        County&#8217;s (20) designated land commonly used for livestock grazing 
        includes WHR habitat types of coastal oak woodland, montane hardwood-conifer, 
        montane hardwood, montane riparian, valley foothill riparian, and annual 
        grassland. The database also includes species lists for habitat types 
        likely to be found if agriculture is intensified in the County&#8217;s 
        (20) designated lands: cropland, orchard-vineyard, and urban. The intensified 
        agricultural production categories greatly reduce biodiversity.</p>
      <p>The number of wildlife species, especially native species, is considerably 
        larger in habitat types used for livestock grazing than in the more intensive 
        cultivated habitat types. Indeed, California&#8217;s oak woodlands, where 
        the predominant use is livestock grazing, are home to a greater diversity 
        of wildlife species than any other major habitat type in the state (Standiford 
        1999; Mayer et al. 1986). In contrast, according to the California Wildlife 
        Habitat Relationships Database habitat descriptions for "cropland" 
        and "orchard-vineyard" types, "Croplands have greatly 
        reduced the wildlife richness and diversity of California," and 
        "Larger and more diverse populations of wildlife were supported 
        by the native habitats [displaced by orchards-vineyards]" (Meyer 
        and Laudenslayer 1988, pp. 138, 140).</p>
      <p>In addition to the wildlife value of the grazing land habitat types per 
        se, the large and contiguous nature of grazing lands is an important factor 
        in their biological value. When habitat is reduced in size and isolated 
        by intervening cropland or housing, the survival of some wildlife and 
        plant populations can be jeopardized (Saunders et al. 1991; Soul&eacute; 
        et al. 1988). Cropland, orchards, and rural residential development of 
        the type proposed for the (20) designated lands are likely to fragment 
        habitat to a much greater degree than extensive rangeland grazing operations. 
        For example, a recent study in Sonoma County&#8217;s hardwood rangeland 
        found that the percent of neotropical bird species was significantly higher 
        in large (&gt; 300 acres) parcels than in 10 - 40 acre ranchettes or 0.5 
        &#8211;2.5 acre single-family home lots (Merenlender and Heise 1999).</p>
      <p><strong>Watershed values / Soil and vegetation disturbance</strong></p>
      <p> Another notable public benefit produced by rangelands is watershed protection. 
        Most of California&#8217;s water supply flows through hardwood rangelands 
        (Standiford 1999). Water quality would likely deteriorate if grazing land 
        were replaced by intensive agriculture. The impact of livestock grazing 
        on water quality is small compared to that of intensive agricultural activities. 
        Fertilizer and pesticide use on rangelands is minimal. In contrast, intensive 
        agriculture typically employs petro-chemical inputs. Numerous, intensive 
        agricultural operations spread over a large area of the County&#8217;s 
        (20) designated lands may cause significant non-point source water pollution 
        problems that prove difficult to solve. Soil disturbance and changes in 
        vegetation type and vegetation cover are commonly limited in rangeland 
        livestock operations. Clearing of vegetation and disturbance of soil is 
        likely to occur at much higher levels and with greater frequency as intensive 
        agricultural activities increase.</p>
      <p><strong>Visual amenities</strong></p>
      <p> Large, contiguous areas of rangeland provide open space viewsheds available 
        to the public, even when the land is privately owned (Huntsinger and Hopkinson 
        1996). Under the scenario envisioned in the General Plan Amendment, grazing 
        land would be interspersed with numerous small farms and houses. The open 
        space character of the (20) designated lands would likely be changed significantly. 
        In addition, the interspersing of houses and ranchlands increases costs 
        to livestock producers.</p>
      <p><strong>Neighbor issues</strong></p>
      <p> In a region under intense development pressure, such as San Diego County, 
        small minimum lot size zoning will result in the rapid advance of housing 
        into agricultural zones, especially those in which the per acre agricultural 
        return is fairly low.</p>
      <p>Research shows that as residential development disperses into rangeland 
        areas, the business and cultural practices of livestock ranching are hindered 
        (Hargrave 1993; Forero et al. 1991). Increased liability costs, trespass, 
        vandalism, careless use of gates, and marauding pet dogs hamper the smooth 
        operation of ranching, reducing not only the financial returns of the 
        business but also satisfaction with the lifestyle that ranchers say is 
        such a vital part of their compensation (Liffmann and Huntsinger 2000; 
        Smith and Martin 1972). Restrictions on traditional management practices, 
        such as prescribed burning, may be imposed on ranching operations, and 
        informal customs of dispute resolution may break down as ex-urbanites 
        move into agricultural areas (Ellickson 1991, 1986).</p>
      <p>In addition, as the demand for houses rises in agricultural areas, land 
        prices increase, and real estate speculation becomes more frequent. All 
        these factors foster what researchers have termed the "impermanence 
        syndrome" (Heimlich and Anderson 1987). Spurred by inflated land 
        values and demoralized by conflicts with urban neighbors, ranchers begin 
        to view their livestock operation as a "holding pattern" preceding 
        residential development. Land stewardship may taper off as resource sustainability 
        loses its importance as a long-term goal (Heimlich and Anderson 1987).</p>
      <p>As residential development increases and ranchers leave the business, 
        a threshold may be reached past which ranching is no longer viable in 
        the region (Liffmann and Huntsinger 2000). A critical mass of livestock 
        operations is needed in any ranching region to support the industry&#8217;s 
        infrastructure and to provide informal labor pools (Hart 1991).</p>
      <p>Facilitating livestock operations in the (20) designated lands will necessitate, 
        among other strategies mentioned below, discouraging widespread residential 
        development. Minimum lot sizes greater than those put forward in the General 
        Plan Amendment are required to achieve this aim. William W. Wood, an agricultural 
        economist, asserts that due to conflicts likely to occur when ex-urbanites 
        move into agricultural areas, "almost a zero density [of residences] 
        is about the only compatible one" (quoted in Hart 1991, p. 37). 
        In the San Francisco Bay Area, a region that also faces intense development 
        pressure on its grazing lands, minimum lot sizes are set at 60 acres in 
        three counties, 100 acres in one county, and 160 acres in three counties 
        (Schuyler et al. 1996).</p>
      <p><strong>Ranching viability</strong></p>
      <p> Researchers have recognized for some time that estate taxes present 
        a major problem for ranchers who typically have small cash reserves but 
        substantial assets in land (Johnson 1998). However, selling off small 
        parcels of ranch land to pay taxes is not generally viewed as a solution 
        that results in the long-term preservation of ranching operations or rangelands. 
        Rather, it is a slow "death by a thousand cuts," especially when residential 
        development occurs on the parcels sold. Other techniques for addressing 
        the problem of estate taxes, such as conservation easements, show greater 
        promise (Wright 1994; Wright 1993). Conservation easements and economic 
        incentives for land conservation can also serve as sources of operating 
        capital.</p>
      <p>Preserving livestock operations and the extensive land base they require 
        is more than just a matter of minimum lot size zoning. However, as experience 
        in other California counties has shown, zoning for large minimum lot sizes 
        is an important first step in a comprehensive planning strategy (Huntsinger 
        and Hopkinson 1996; Hart 1991). In Marin County, such zoning reduced residential 
        development pressure while ranchers, county planners, and others developed 
        a lasting solution for the preservation of ranching. Had large minimum 
        lot sizes not been imposed, few ranches would have survived to be preserved 
        (Hart 1991).</p>
      <p>In counties contending with enormous development pressure, such as Marin 
        County and Contra Costa County, minimum lot zoning has provided only temporary, 
        albeit vital, protection. The agricultural land base continues to dwindle 
        because real estate buyers are willing to purchase large lots for non-agricultural 
        purposes. Zoning is also vulnerable to changes in the political climate 
        (Huntsinger and Hopkinson 1996). </p>
      <p>Long-term solutions that are successfully protecting livestock grazing 
        and its land base in other California counties and in areas across the 
        Western U. S. include: </p>
      <p>&#8226; firm urban limit boundaries, </p>
      <p>&#8226; conservation easements / land trust programs, </p>
      <p>&#8226; coalitions between ranchers, conservationists, and government 
        planners, and</p>
      <p>&#8226; incentive programs for land owners (Huntsinger and Hopkinson 
        1996). </p>
      <p><strong><u>Summary/Conclusions</u></strong></p>
      <p>1. Rangeland grazing is an extensive land use that, compared to field 
        agriculture, requires minimal disruption of wildlife andwildlife habitat, 
        soils, and watershed. Most of the (20) designated areas have been used 
        for livestock grazing for a hundred years or more, and the present landscape 
        has been shaped by that land use.</p>
      <p>2. The rangelands of the (20) designated lands are productive southern 
        California rangelands. Upland range is complemented by meadowlands, public 
        range, and other sources of feed. Typical Southern Californian grasslands 
        have expected productivities of .1 to .7 Animal Unit Months depending 
        on slope and with a tree or shrub canopy cover of less than 50% (McDougald 
        et al. 1991). The upland range soils of the (20) designated areas are 
        quite productive by this standard. Forest Service analysis of mountain 
        meadow types in the area show that they exceed this productivity by several 
        times.</p>
      <p>3. The Soil Survey of San Diego County puts the common soils of the (20) 
        designated lands into "capability groupings" that indicate 
        severe limitations for agricultural use. Almost exclusively, NRCS recommends 
        limiting their use to pasture, range, woodland, or wildlife habitat.</p>
      <p>4. Intermingling of residential development and ranch land results in 
        conflicts that increase costs and difficulties to producers. As the number 
        of producers declines, so does the supporting industrial infrastructure, 
        as well as informal support networks. Residential development often tends 
        to occur first in areas of vital importance to livestock producers because 
        of their high productivity: meadowlands and oak woodlands. Loss of these 
        lands to development renders upland range less usable.</p>
      <p>5. Conservation of grazing lands and ranches is a goal of a variety of 
        programs in the western United States. It is not easy, but potentially 
        can provide a wide range of public goods, as well as agricultural products 
        and the conservation of a historically significant way of life.</p>

        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
      <p>[1] Annual forage produced on rangelands for livestock grazing is generally 
        presented in pounds per acre. Monitoring of productivity over years provides 
        typical forage production for various range sites in low rainfall and 
        high rainfall years. It is general practice in California to plan for 
        somewhere in between. The pounds per acre produced on a range site is 
        then modified by the amount that can be grazed by livestock without damaging 
        soils or plant productivity. This results in "Available" forage, 
        which is forage available for grazing on a sustainable basis. Finally, 
        this is converted to "AUMs", Animal-Unit-Months. AUMs are 
        the amount of forage needed to support one breeding cow for one month. 
        Horses require a bit more than one AUM, sheep .20 AUM. </p>
      <p>As has been earlier described, AUMs on private rangeland are typically 
        supplemented by feed, public range, wet meadows or pasture, agricultural 
        by products, supplements and so forth. For example, Forest Service grazing 
        leases are often for 2-3 months of the year in the summer. During the 
        rest of the year, the herd is carried on private ground, other leased 
        pasture, feed and so forth. Two hundred leased AUMs on Forest Service 
        land may typically be supporting one hundred head for part of the year. 
        Sometimes, this is a part of the year when other options are limited or 
        expensive.</p>
      <p>Available forage productivity can be affected also by increases in unpalatable 
        species, or dense trees and shrubs. Low densities of trees&#8212;for example 
        the open oak savannahs found in central San Diego County &#8211; may result 
        in greater than expected forage production or better temporal distribution 
        of forage quality (Frost and McDougald, 1989). Some shrubs are also grazed 
        by livestock and can be used, particularly during times of the year when 
        the grass is dry.<br>
