    <TD> <p>SOFAR's actions are predicated on the evidence that San Diego County 

        legislators have repeatedly failed to plan for resource protection. A 

        brief synopsis of the more significant ruptures in leadership follow here. 

        At the bottom of the list are examples of two Citizen Initiatives to correct 

        County Failures. </p>

      <p>1965- Williamson Act Legislation </p>

      <blockquote>What it is: This beneficial Act provides for the establishment 

        of agricultural preserves to grant tax breaks for agricultural uses. <br>

        County Failure: Residential underlay zoning has produced exactly the opposite 

        of the Williamson Act intent making the public subsidize future development 

        and causing the loss of thousands of acres of agricultural land. <br>

        Estimated Planning Cost: $50,000.</blockquote>

      <p>1973- Open Space Element</p>

      <blockquote>What it is: State-required General Plan Element that identifies 

        and protects productive open space lands.</blockquote>

      <p>1973- Draft Open Space Element</p>

        

      <blockquote>What it is: Recommended 25-acre rural zoning. <br>

        County Failure: Not adopted. Open space lands do not have

      State-required zoning nor co-equal status with other land uses. <br>

        Estimated Planning Cost: $ 100,000.</blockquote>

      <p> 1973- Supervisor Jack Walsh Letter</p>

      <blockquote>Documenting that Open Space Committee was packed with special 

        interest.</blockquote>

      <p>1973- Proposed Large-Lot Zoning</p>

      <blockquote>What it is: Proposed zoning ordinance amendment to provide<br>

        for larger minimum lot sizes in the agricultural and limited control zones. 

        <br>

        County Failure: Result: not adopted. <br>

        Cost: $20,000.</blockquote>

      <p>1975- Conservation Element</p>

      <blockquote>What it is: State-required General Plan Element to identify and<br>

        protect all community, cultural, geographical, and natural resources. 

        <br>

        County Failure: Result: enactment of Resource Conservation Areas with 

        no regulatory power. <br>

        Cost: $100,000.</blockquote>

      <p>1978- Land Use Element</p>

      <blockquote>What it is: State-required General Plan Element. <br>

        County Failure: no rural densities but required as mitigation the<br>

        adoption of an agricultural element. <br>

        Cost: $200,000.</blockquote>

      <p>1979- Draft Agricultural Element</p>

      <blockquote>What it is: An exhaustive economic and land-use study; affected 

        750 square miles of rural lands; and was two years in the making.<br>

        County Failure: Not adopted. <br>

        Cost: $500,000.</blockquote>

      <p>1980- Rural Community Plan Updates</p>

      <blockquote>What it is: Ten rural community plans were up-dated with <br>

        accompanying EIRs. <br>

        County Failure: Still no rural zoning.<br>

        Cost: $1,500,000.</blockquote>

      <p>1981- Central Mountain Plan Update</p>

      <blockquote>What it is: County initiates GPA 91-02, the Central Mountain 

        Plan update, planning for the heart of the forest lands. <br>

        County Failure: legal challenge, and court-ordered moratorium and processing 

        of new plan. <br>

        Cost: $1,000,000.</blockquote>

      <p>1982- Multi-Species Conservation Plan</p>

      <blockquote>What it is: Mitigation plan to protect 85 endangered species.<br>

        Developer-driven plan with little scientific base. Plan is acquisition-based 

        with public slated to pick up most of the cost. Sprawl continues unchecked.<br>

        Without rural zoning, cost to American taxpayers would be exorbitant. 

        <br>

        County Failure: Plan adopted in late1997. <br>

        Planning Cost to City and County: $4,000,000 plus.<br>

        Acquisition Cost could be $1 billion or more.</blockquote>

      <p>1993- GPA 94-01</p>

      <blockquote>What it is: Proposed urban limit line and rural zoning general 

        plan amendment. <br>

        County Failure: Legal challenge and court-ordered moratorium. <br>

        Cost: $100,000. </blockquote>

      <p>1994- Rural Task Force</p>

      <blockquote>What it is: Group to tackle issues facing County's rural lands.<br>

      County Failure: no actions adopted. <br>

      Cost: $32,000.</blockquote>

      <p>1995- AG 20 Lawsuit</p>

      <blockquote>What it is: SOFAR's successful legal challenge of County's<br>

        urban Zoning on agricultural preserve farmlands.<br>

        County Failure: Court-ordered moratorium. County required to bring its 

        General Plan into compliance with State law. Mandated adoption of Agricultural 

        Element.<br>

        Cost: $100,000.</blockquote>

      <p>1996- GPA 96-03</p>

      <blockquote>What it is: County's response to court order to properly protect<br>

        agricultural preserve farmlands. Will control fate of almost 200,000 acres 

        of Country's backcountry farmland. Will also impact additional 500,000 

        acres<br>

        of agricultural land to be covered by Agricultural Element. <br>

        County Failure: Planning Commission hearing scheduled for January 21, 

        2000.<br>

        Estimated Cost: $100,000</blockquote>

      <p>1998- General Plan 2020.</p>

      <blockquote>What it is: Update of County's General Plan. Could take 3 years. 

        County population expected to grow by 1 million residents by 2020. Plan 

        will determine how that future growth will be absorbed and distributed 

        in<br>

        the unincorporated. <br>

        County Failure: Too little, too late. <br>

        Estimated Cost: $3 million. </blockquote>

      <p align="center"><strong>Cost of rural planning failure by County of San 

        Diego OVER 11 MILLION DOLLARS.</strong> </p>

      <p><strong>Citizen-Initiatives: </strong></p>

      <p>1992- Forest Conservation Plan (Successful Initiative)</p>

      <blockquote> What it is: Qualified with 110,000 signatures. Plan to save 

        the forest with 40-acre large-lot zoning.<br>

        County Failure: Inappropriate zoning forced citizen's group to amend <br>

        Forest Plan.<br>

        Cost: Virtually no cost to taxpayers.</blockquote>

      <p>1997- Proposition B &shy; Rural Heritage &amp; Watershed Initiative (Unsuccessful)</p>

      <blockquote>What it is: A land-use measure that would amend the General 

        Plan to prevent urban development from County's rural lands. Would implement 

        County's own growth management plan. <br>

        County Failure: Special interests and the Farm Bureau teamed up with the 

        Country to defeat citizen's initiative. Evidence County officials 

        illegally campaigned against Prop B.<br>

        Cost: Virtually no cost to taxpayers.</blockquote>
