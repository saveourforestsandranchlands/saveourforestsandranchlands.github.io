        Happy Summer!</u></font></strong></p>

      <p>We have lots to share with you about our recent activities and work since 

        the last Watchdog newsletter- </p>

      <p>But first, a great big Thank You to all our supporters for helping to 

        make our latest fundraiser so successful. As you know, SOFAR relies on 

        its members' contributions to help sustain our efforts; things like 

        hiring consultants to prepare professional comments on questionable projects, 

        legal representation in efforts like General Plan Amendment 96-03, and 

        keeping up our public outreach efforts through our website (www.sofar.org) 

        and mailings. We appreciate your confidence in us to defend against sprawl 

        development, and thereby help keep San Diego a place we want to call home. 

      </p>

      <blockquote>WE WON! In what arguably is the most protracted and politically important 

        battle over San Diego's backcountry, SOFAR has been vindicated a 

        third time in the contest over General Plan Amendment 96-03. As you may 

        have read in last week's Union-Tribune articles, the County has 

        vacated the project for 96-03 (See our website for a MUST SEE Union-Tribune 

        Editorial from August 12, 2001). In layman's terms, this means that 

        the County appears to be abiding by the Court's ruling to plan for 

        the area affected by the lawsuit, 190,000 acres of rural San Diego back 

        country lands. The County will have to come up with another plan for this 

        area and they will have to show that they have done adequate environmental 

        review of the impacts of their new plan to the satisfaction of the Court. 

        However, the County never lacking in audacity, arrogance, and contempt 

        for the public good, has already drafted a new Environmental Impact Report 

        for 96-03 and is pushing for its rapid approval. This tactic raises serious 

        questions about the quality of the new EIR, its relation to the 2020 General 

        Planning efforts of the County, and to the politics of 2002 elections 

        where at least two board members are up for re-election. Of course, SOFAR 

        will continue to look at the County's plan carefully to ensure the 

        plan stands up to the principles of good planning for our region. </blockquote>

      <blockquote>The Board has not yet officially announced when they will take action 

        to vacate GPA 96-03. They are required to do so by mid-September. We plan 

        to hold a press conference at that time. We will keep you posted on the 

        date and invite you all to attend. </blockquote>

      <p><strong><font size="2"><u>Regional Government Efficiency Commission (RGEC)</u></font></strong></p>

      <blockquote>Many of you have probably heard by now that there was a study of regional 

        governance alternatives underway here in our county. (For information 

        on the mandate of the Commission and the recommendations it forwarded 

        to the State of California, please see www.sdrgec.com) The Commission 

        determined that the region's problems should be handled by a new 

        regional government in the County that would have &#8220;veto&#8221; authority 

        over regional land use decisions of local governments in the County, and 

        the power to without transportation funding from jurisdictions that do 

        not abide by regional plans. SOFAR seemed to be the only voice in the 

        desert that thought the Commission failed to consider the many failures 

        of government to accomplish truly integrated land use and transportation 

        planning without an adopted Plan. In the spirit of our concern that the 

        Commission was misguided in this endeavor, SOFAR submitted the following 

        letter, which affirms our unswerving position that, in light of the continual 

        failure of legislators to make land use decisions in the interest of the 

        regional community, the first item of order should be the presentation 

        to the voters of a regional land use plan: </blockquote>

      <blockquote>Our website has been updated with backcountry projects in the County. 

        Over 27,000 acres are slated for development in the rural areas of our 

        County. To our knowledge, no other group, other than the County, maintains 

        a record of projects affecting our backcountry lands. SOFAR maintains 

        this part of our website for 23 different unincorporated areas of our 

        County. Each project we inventory lists the environmental setting of the 

        land, the acreage involved, and the number of homes proposed for the site, 

        and the current planning status. The project number is an easy reference 

        tag that you can use to investigate the project further or to submit comments 

        to the County Department of Planning and Land Use. Go to our website for 

        the most recent list, Summer 2001, of projects. </blockquote>

      <p>Last but not least, SOFAR has moved into a new office downtown and we 

        invite you to stop in and say hello if you're in the area. We're

      <p><u><strong><font size="2">Regional Government Efficiency Comment Letter 

        Submitted by SOFAR:</font></strong></u></p>

      

      <p>July 25, 2001 </p>

      <p>Honorable Byron Wear, Chairman<br>

        Regional Government Efficiency Commission<br>

        1230 Third Ave.<br>

        Suite 224<br>

        San Diego, CA 92101</p>

      <p><br>

        Dear Chairman Wear, </p>

      <p>Save Our Forest And Ranchlands (SOFAR) is a grass-roots organization 

        dedicated to the protection of the wilderness, watershed, agricultural, 

        and scenic resources of San Diego County. We are composed of concerned 

        citizens and experts in the fields of land use, conservation of natural 

        resources, land planning, and biology. Additionally, we are the court-approved 

        land use authority for 250,000 acres of rural San Diego backcountry due 

        to our sustained and successful efforts to defend against inappropriate 

        conversion of wildlands to development. </p>

      <p>Today, we respectfully submit our comments to the Regional Government 

        Efficiency Commission (RGEC) as they prepare to tender their recommendations 

        to the Governor of California for plans to coordinate transportation planning 

        efforts in an expanded or new form of regional government for the San 

        Diego region. </p>

      <p>SOFAR is concerned that RGEC is repeating the same level of thinking 

        that created the intractable problems it is supposed to resolve. SOFAR 

        acknowledges the need for a logical consolidation of governing agencies. 

        However, we believe that planning, not governance, is the necessary first 

        step in solving San Diego's regional growth problems. First, adopt 

        a plan to tackle sprawl, then empower existing agencies to administer 

        the plan. </p>

      <p>There is precedence for putting the plan first. In 1988, San Diego County 

        voters endorsed the establishment of such a plan when they voted for a 

        &#8220;Regional Planning and Growth Control Measure.&#8221; The text of 

        the Proposition they endorsed conferred regulatory power&#8212;enforceable 

        authority&#8212;upon the Regional Growth Management Review Board. Ultimately, 

        SANDAG was established as the Review Board, and five years later, it adopted 

        a Plan to resolve regional problems associated with haphazard development. 

      </p>

      <p>We all know that this Plan has never been implemented, chiefly because 

        fragmented decision-making preordains that meaningful action will be lost 

        to unproductive (albeit amiable) &#8220;consensus-building.&#8221; Still, 

        RGEC proposes to introduce another provincially elected governing body 

        to correct where SANDAG has failed, which delays implementation of a regional 

        plan even longer. </p>

      <p>RGEC would be wise to observe that Portland's Metro, the model 

        for RGEC's new plan, did not achieve its high standard of living 

        by first establishing a governing body. Rather, it began with a plan, 

        a plan that defined the limits of, and programmed the timing of, urban 

        development. Metro's governance structure came after the Oregon 

        Growth Management Plan had been legally enacted. </p>

      <p>Therefore, SOFAR proposes that RGEC's primary task is to institute 

        a regional plan to stem the tide of urban sprawl. If implemented, a regional 

        plan will improve integrated transportation, land use, and open space 

        planning exponentially. SOFAR argues that an Urban Growth Boundary is 

        a sensible, logical, effective tool to bring about this fundamental shift. 

      </p>

      <p>In June 2000, the Public Policy Institute surveyed 2000 San Diego County 

        residents about their attitudes toward growth and governance in the region. 

        The results are astounding, and they support SOFAR's position on 

        this matter. Significantly, the poll indicates that voters do not have 

        confidence in government and that they believe that greed and corruption, 

        lack of effective planning, and overdevelopment in the wrong places are 

        among the serious problems of the region. Furthermore, 67% of voters support 

        the establishment of an Urban Growth Boundary in the County. Clearly, 

        the voters have witnessed the inability of government to stand up for 

        their interests and they see that defined urban limits would help respond 

        to that need. </p>

      <p>The table below is a partial reproduction of the poll's results.
