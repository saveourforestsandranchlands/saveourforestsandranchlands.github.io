    <TD> <p>Editorial by Alexander Cockburn <br>

        published by &quot;The Nation&quot; 19 June 2000: </p>

      <p>&quot;The End of Southern California&quot; There are thousands of vistas 

        in America affording material for sermons on the folly and greed of man, 

        but few so stark and wretched as San Diego County, now distinguished by 

        having the highest rate of habitat loss and more endangered plant and 

        animal species than any county in the United States. The butchery has 

        accelerated hotly in the Clinton/Gore era, with the developers unleashed 

        by a dreadful instrument of the &quot;win-win&quot; school of regulation 

        (Multi-Species Conservation Plan, in their language), now supervised by 

        Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt. &quot;Win-win&quot; means developers 

        get the prime habitat and endangered species get a culvert (&quot;wildlife 

        corridor&quot;). </p>

      <p>By the mid-nineties, Southern California's coastal sage scrub had almost 

        disappeared; so had 97 percent of the vernal pools. Southern maritime 

        chaparral had been reduced to 2,400 acres in the United States, with 400 

        of these on Carmel Mountain just west of what is now one of the largest 

        freeway interchanges in California. The chaparral has gone, and so too, 

        as a site for anything but high-priced real estate, has poor, bulldozer-carved 

        Carmel Mountain. </p>

      <p>So far as coastal habitat in Southern California is concerned, the destruction 

        is virtually complete, but head south from Los Angeles, turn east after 

        Oceanside and head for Ramona or Julian. You'll discover that at the heart 

        of San Diego County are mountains forming a blue wall between the coast 

        and the deep desert. Rising to these peaks, and buffering them from the 

        cities, are the magnificent rolling grasslands and oak-covered foothills 

        of what San Diegans call the back country, its pastures carrying not only 

        cattle but live oak and golden eagles, profuse other bird life, cougar. 

        The country looks dry but is an enormously important watershed, supplying 

        the coastal cities with as much as 15 percent of their water. </p>

      <p>Right now the real estate market in California is so feverish that the 

        big ranches are ripe targets for &quot;development&quot; the minute they 

        are rezoned out of agricultural designation and onto the open market. 

        Given the power of the developers this transition from cattle baronies 

        to real estate cash should have been easy, were it not for the efforts 

        of a small group of environmentalists. Over the past ten years, Save Our 

        Forest and Ranchlands (SOFAR), run by Duncan McFetridge, a woodworker 

        living in Descanso, forty miles east of San Diego, has been waging a stubborn 

        campaign against the suburbanization of the back country. We're not talking 

        firebrands here. We're talking League of Women Voters, surfers, San Diego 

        Baykeeper and assorted defenders of snakes, salamanders, lions and oaks. 

        SOFAR put together a coalition of enviro and community groups and sued 

        the county for failing to protect the back country. </p>

      <p>In 1996 Superior Court Judge Judith McConnell found San Diego County 

        grossly negligent and in violation of several state laws and its own environmental 

        standards. McConnell gave tiny SOFAR authority over hundreds of thousands 

        of back-country acres. Finally, earlier this year, the county came up 

        with a plan. It assumed the destruction of all the 200,000 acres of rangelands, 

        with division of this savaged terrain into ten- and forty-acre parcels, 

        demurely described as small farms. This pleasing vision of mom and pop 

        truck farms raising mangoes, orchids and macadamia nuts (the Farm Bureau's 

        disingenuous version) collides with the reality that this part of San 

        Diego County has no ground water suitable for such specialty farming, 

        and little other infrastructure. </p>

      <p>The real future under the county plan would be luxury ranchettes and 

        theme parks linked by new freeways and serviced by off-ramp commerce. 

        In other words, exactly the sort of unsmart growth that everyone from 

        Vice President Gore to the San Diego Association of Governments has been 

        complaining about. Not to be defeated, SOFAR and its allies brought the 

        new plan to the attention of the Environmental Protection Agency. On March 

        31 Nancy Woo, the agency's regional chief, sent a letter to the San Diego 

        County supervisors, also to Mayor Susan Golding, advising them that the 

        plan threatened the quality and quantity of the region's water and would 

        gravely affect air, endangered wildlife and open space. Woo's letter threw 

        the county officials into desperation. It looked as though the scheming 

        of years had gone for nought. </p>

      <p>Then, at the last minute, came an amazing gift from the EPA. Five days 

        later, on the eve of a crucial April 5 county meeting, Woo rushed another 

        letter to the frantic San Diego officials. She said she had misinterpreted 

        the plan and that her first letter should be disregarded. In fact, Woo 

        had not misinterpreted any significant part of the plan. But crucially, 

        in her second letter she did not advise the board to withhold approval 

        pending further study. The supervisors were off the hook and delightedly 

        passed the amendment that could mean San Diego's back country will disappear 

        into condoland, interspersed with Indian casinos. But the game is not 

        quite over. Because the county is still under court supervision, the plan 

        can't go ahead until Judge McConnell signs off on it. </p>

      <p>So here we have a major environmental disaster in the making, one that 

        is an obvious test case for any supposed commitment by local, state and 

        federalgovernment to bar insane squandering of natural resources. We have 

        county government acting as a creature of the big developers. We have 

        a weak regulatory agency, with the nature-rapers held in check only by 

        a stubborn group like SOFAR. </p>

      <p>This is but one episode in a dire national story. I don't want to be 

        construed as offering endorsement or encouragement, but what drives groups 

        like Earth Liberation Front to court lifetime prison sentences by burning 

        a ski-condo development in Vail, or Boise Cascade offices in Oregon? The 

        people who drive them to it, who are convinced that the fix is in, that 

        the government is always bought, have been these past eight years men 

        like Gore and Babbitt, so much more supple and therefore dangerous than 

        Reagan's Interior Secretary James Watt, who was such a dunderhead he set 

        back the course of environmental destruction by a decade. </p>
