        ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS ASK COUNTY TO REVERSE <br>

        'PRO-DEVELOPER, ANTI-DEMOCRATIC' ACTIONS</strong>

      </p>

      <p> In anticipation of its August 6, 2003 meeting, four prominent citizen 

        groups (SOFAR, Surfrider Foundation, SD BayKeeper, the Backcountry Coalition) 

        have asked the County Board of Supervisors to reverse recently taken and 

        pending actions that "threaten to undermine the democratic process" and 

        "place General Plan 2020 policies at risk before they are implemented." 

        The groups cited County proposals that would favor developers over citizens, 

        and eliminate environmental groups from key advisory functions. </p>

      <p> In one of the most remarkable items ever placed on a Board of Supervisor's 

        agenda, County staff is recommending dismissal of members on the GP 2020 

        advisory group who were found to have "a conflict of purpose with the 

        2020 Plan process." The challenge to membership on the interest group 

        was first brought forward by individuals with development interests, and 

        targeted the members believed to be supporting a proposed County land 

        use initiative. The proposed removal is seen as an end-run assault on 

        the initiative. </p>

      <p> The recalcitrant environmentalists were first charged with having a 

        "conflict of interest." When it was shown that this financial interest 

        standard equally applied to those members with development interests, 

        the charge "conflict of interest" was modified to "conflict of purpose." 

        While the County has a long history of anti-democratic actions, use of 

        the new "conflict of purpose" test to decide membership and voting rights 

        on a democratically appointed board is unprecedented. </p>

      <p> The groups said these actions "reinforce public perception that the 

        County will not administer new General Plan 2020 policies in a fair and 

        even-handed manner." Failure to reverse actions, the groups argued, "will 

        lead many citizens to believe that harmful land-use patterns will continue, 

        regardless of how salutary the County might argue its new General Plan 

        policies are on paper." </p>

      <p> The groups argued the County already "labored under the burden of credibility 

        problem" given the County's seven year track record of "illegal decision 

        making on matters of fundamental importance and of clear favoritism of 

        development interests." </p>

      <p> Members, Board of County Supervisors&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

	  August 4, 2003<br>

        County of San Diego <br>

        1600 Pacific Highway<br>

        San Diego, California 92101<br>

      </p>

      <p> Re: County General Plan Update 2020 Process </p>

      <p> Dear Supervisors: </p>

      <p> We write out of concern that recent actions of county government will 

        undermine public confidence in the fairness of administration of county 

        land use policy pursuant to the General Plan process, now scheduled for 

        completion next year. By this letter, we ask the Board to reverse or modify 

        these actions. </p>

      <p> I The County's Reputation for Fair Land Use Policy Administration Was 

        Already Operating Under a Cloud when the General Plan 2020 Process Began 

      </p>

      <p> Unfortunately, the county did not begin the General Plan Update process 

        in 1997 with a clean slate. Numerous actions of the county tended to undercut 

        the credibility of the Board of Supervisors and the leadership of the 

        planning office in terms of fair and balanced discharge of its land use 

        planning responsibilities under state law. As the Union Tribune recently 

        editorialized, "For decades, the county has been doing back-flips trying 

        to justify a land use plan that claims to preserve agricultural acreage 

        while in reality paving the way for development." (Derelict Board, April 

        17, 2002) </p>

      <blockquote> A. Illegal Policies </blockquote>

      <p> Three times since l996 state judges have ruled county land use policies 

        purporting to protect hundreds of thousands of acres of rural land violate 

        state laws. </p>

      <blockquote> B. Loss of Normal Permitting Authority </blockquote>

      <p> The courts deemed the county's performance so egregious that it took 

        the nationally unprecedented action of declaring a development moratorium 

        on 250,000 acres, stripping the county of its normal development review 

        authority, and transferring that authority to a private, nonprofit organization, 

        Save Our Forest and Ranch Lands (SOFAR). No other major municipality in 

        America has been the object of such a dramatic judicial denunciation of 

        its land use decision-making. </p>

      <blockquote> C. California Attorney General Joins in Legal Claim Against 

        County </blockquote>

      <p> On June 13, 2000 California Attorney General Bill Lockyer joined in 

        a lawsuit initiated by SOFAR. It is highly unusual for a state attorney 

        general to ask a state court to overturn a municipal land use policy. 

        The Attorney General contended that the county's violations of state law 

        governing county land use policy "may result in significant and avoidable 

        adverse impacts on the natural resources of the state. California Superior 

        Court Judge Judith McConnell agreed with the Attorney General, and invalidated 

        the county's general plan. </p>

      <blockquote> D. Delay in Modernizing the General Plan </blockquote>

      <p> The County announced in 1997 that the review and update process would 

        be complete by 2000. In the County's latest announcement however, 2004 

        is suggested as a likely completion date of the plan. This delay has wasted 

        and continues to waste staff time, donated citizen time, tax dollars, 

        and Board time and energy. In addition, the effect of delaying modernization 

        of the plan has been to leave old, development-favoring zoning in place, 

        thus allowing development that nearly any configuration of new GP 2020 

        policies would preclude. </p>

      <blockquote> E. Favoring Developers over Citizen Participants </blockquote>

      <p> In 2001, after nearly four years of effort, the county was poised to 

        adopt policies that would have offered improved protection of rural land. 

        "Alternative 3" was favored by many community planning groups which had 

        participated extensively in the process, as well as by county staff. However, 

        developers and land speculators objected to the policies and boldly demanded, 

        in the then famous "Stonegate memo," that the County Supervisors scrap 

        four years of effort and go back to the drawing board. To the amazement 

        of many, the county capitulated to the developers' demand. </p>

      <p> Given the above track record of (1) illegal decision-making on matters 

        of fundamental importance and (2) clear favoritism of development interests, 

        it is small wonder that county land use decision-making labored under 

        the burden of a credibility problem as the county restarted the General 

        Plan 2020 process in 2001. 

      <blockquote> II Recent Actions Further Erode the County's Land Use Credibility 

      </blockquote>

      <p> The county has recently taken four actions each of which reinforce public 

        perception that the county will not administer the GP 2020 policies or 

        other land use policies in a fair and evenhanded manner. Specifically, 

        these actions (1) threaten to undermine or seriously erode GP 2020 policies 

        before they are even put in place; (2) give developers unprecedented procedural 

        advantages, and citizens unprecedented procedural disadvantages, in the 

        crucial plan amendment process; and (3) eliminate informed and credible 

        environmental voices in the county's most important land use policy advisory 

        body, the Interest Group Committee. </p>

      <blockquote> A. "Referral" Process </blockquote>

      <p> The GP 2020 process now contemplates adoption of policies that will 

        limit development on rural land. At the same time, county officials have 

        invited landowners who do not like limitations on land use to ask the 

        county to exempt their land from the limitations, or to otherwise modify 

        application of the proposed policies. The so-called "referral process" 

        is not adequately defined in terms of purpose or operating criteria. Inadequate 

        substantive criteria invite disappointment by landowners, and harmful 

        consequences to the unsuspecting public. </p>

      <p> We are alarmed that county supervisors and staff have received perhaps 

        hundreds of "referral" requests. We urge the county, prior to any further 

        administration of the referral procedure, to strengthen the criteria for 

        reviewing landowner exemption requests -- for example, adopting criteria 

        similar to those applicable to requests for a variance. Absent tight, 

        clear criteria, the county's "referral " process likely will trigger a 

        land rush that will bring the entire GP 2020 process to a controversial 

        meltdown. </p>

      <p> Given the potential for abuse, as well as the potential for unraveling 

        the GP 2020 process, the county should also adopt procedures that assure 

        transparency of the process. An official list of all requests submitted 

        pursuant to this procedure should be maintained and made available for 

        inspection by the public and by representatives of the media. A formal 

        status report of this list should be submitted monthly to the Board. The 

        report should also identify procedures by which interested citizens may 

        comment on the submissions. At a bare minimum, nearby landowners should 

        be notified by first class mail of referral submissions, and of related 

        procedures affording opportunity to comment, and to seek review of any 

        initial approval of a submission. This reporting procedure should remain 

        in place through whatever term of time the board allows for this referral 

        procedure to operate. </p>

      <blockquote> B. "Pipeline" policy </blockquote>

      At the start of the revised GP 2020 process in 2001, the County indicated 

      that projects already in the "pipeline" would be exempt from the new General 

      Plan only if they had first obtained a vested right to develop under State 

      law. Unfortunately, County staff are now recommending that the Board scrap 

      this sensible policy - a policy upon which much of the GP 2020 planning 

      work has been premised and that is followed by many other California jurisdictions 

      during general plan updates. Instead, staff now proposes to replace this 

      policy with one that, as Bonnie Gendron aptly states in her July 29, 2003 

      letter to the Board, will allow development to occur where the County has 

      already determined it would be "inappropriate, wasteful of resources, lacking 

      infrastructure, and detrimental to enhanced quality of life." </p> <p> The 

        staff report recommending adoption of this unfounded approach asserts 

        that the proposed action will "serve as an effective guide for orderly 

        growth," is exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), 

        and is "designed to comply with State requirements in Section 66474.2 

        of the Subdivision Map Act." </p>

      <p> Each of these assertions is simply untrue. Indeed, rather than serving 

        as an effective guide for development, the proposed policy would topple 

        the County back into an explicit cave-in-to-the-developers posture from 

        which the County has striven to extricate itself since the disastrous, 

        developer-pressured termination of the original GP 2020 process in 2001. 

        The proposed action is also plainly subject to the CEQA and, far from 

        complying with the Subdivision Map Act, directly contradicts both the 

        language and the spirit of Section 66474.2. Accordingly, SOFAR urges the 

        Board to reject this misguided approach. </p>

      <blockquote> C. Repeal of Policy I- 63 </blockquote>

      <p> GP 2020 would establish a new comprehensive plan for the backcountry. 

        If a developer is unable to gain exemption from the new policies by the 

        "referral" process described above, or if the developer in unable to gain 

        a "pipeline" exemption by filing an application and paying a fee, the 

        developer who missed either of these boats has a third bite at the apple, 

        thanks to the county's recent action repealing the 30-year-old Policy 

        I-63. </p>

      <p> Under Policy I-63 the county could approve a request to change the General 

        Plan only if the proposed change met 6 of 10 criteria. Negative determinations 

        by either the Planning Director or the relevant Community Planning Group 

        resulted in a public hearing before the Planning Commission. </p>

      <p> It is submitted the repeal of Policy I-63 is (1) plainly threatens the 

        integrity of the new GP 2020 Plan, whatever its policies turn out to be, 

        and (2) mocks the idea that the county intends to treat citizens and developers 

        in an evenhanded manner. </p>

      <p> First, the Board eliminated all criteria for plan amendments. Second, 

        the Board gave unlimited discretion to the Planning Director to approve 

        or deny requests to change the General Plan - the "constitution" for all 

        land use policy and decision-making in the county. No substantive criteria 

        limit the Planning Director's discretion. Third, the Board stripped community 

        planning groups of their existing right to appeal initial decisions approving 

        plan amendments. Fourth, the board authorized developers to appeal Planning 

        Director denials of plan amendments to the Planning Commission. Fifth, 

        the Board of Supervisors denied community planning groups the right to 

        appeal Planning Commission approvals to the Board, but authorized developers 

        to appeal Planning Commission denials to the Board. </p>

      <p> Apart from the unfairness of these procedures, the absence of criteria 

        makes it something of a mystery to ponder on what basis people will say 

        the Planning Director was right or wrong. In any event, the combination 

        of no rules and stacked procedures is a surefire recipe for arbitrary 

        decisions and controversy. </p>

      <blockquote> D. Purging the Interest Group Committee </blockquote>

      <p> The Interest Group Committee (IGC) is the county's most important land 

        use policy advisory committee. Made up of interests with a wide range 

        of perspectives and policy goals, the IGC is a laudable attempt by the 

        county to keep disparate voices at the negotiation table, in the hope 

        that much of the final GP 2020 product will have significant consensus 

        support -- a factor that will gain some degree of public confidence in 

        the final outcome. </p>

      <p> At the Board's June 25, 2003 meeting two representatives of the building 

        industry urged the Board to remove members of the IGC who support the 

        Rural Lands Initiative. A few weeks later, Karen Scarborough, County Staff 

        GP 2020 Interest Group Facilitator, delivered a resignation ultimatum 

        to Eric Bowlby, the Sierra Club's IGC representative. The county's Deputy 

        Chief Officer, Bob Copper, recommends that the Board remove from the IGC 

        members with a "conflict of purpose." </p>

      <p> We endorse the reasoning in Bonnie Gendron's July 29, 2003 letter to 

        the board on this subject. Bonnie quite properly rejects the staff's ultimatum 

        to resign. We urge you to do likewise. </p>

      <blockquote> III Conclusion </blockquote>

      <p> The above actions by county government, existing or proposed, suggest 

        the county's land use process remains too heavily influenced by companies 

        and individuals who wish to be free to develop suburban fringe and rural 

        land. Numerous San Diego public agencies officially say such haphazard 

        development will threaten water supplies, increase traffic congestion, 

        and prolong low density, high cost sprawl that for decades has imposed 

        unaffordable housing on young San Diegans struggling to enter the housing 

        market. To avoid these and other serious community harms, and to regain 

        the confidence of the people of San Diego that county government is running 

        a balanced and fair land use process, we urge you to reverse or substantially 

        modify the above actions. Failure to do so likely will lead many citizens 

        to believe that harmful land use patterns will continue, regardless of 

        how salutary the county might argue its GP 2020 policies are on paper. 

      </p>

      <p> Thank you for your consideration of these recommendations. We look forward 

        to presenting them to you directly, and to be available to answer you 

        questions at the Board's August 6, 2003 meeting. </p>

      <p> Respectfully submitted, </p>

      <hr size="1"> <p align="center"> <strong>News Release SOFAR and SANDAG Agree to Study Shift 

        of $510 Million in Transportation Investments</strong> </p>

      <p> For further information contact: </p>

      <p> Duncan McFetridge, Chair, SOFAR<br>

        619-230-1963 </p>

      <p> Gary Gallegos, Executive Director, SANDAG<br>

        619-595-5300 </p>

      <p> In March, San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) approved a 30-year, 

        $42 billion regional transportation plan. SANDAG is expected to approve 

        today an agreement with Save Our Forests and Ranchlands (SOFAR) to study 

        a shift in their regional plan of $510 million in transportation investments 

        from five freeway segments in outlying undeveloped areas to four transportation 

        improvements in developed areas in the City of San Diego and in the City 

        of Chula Vista. </p>

      <p> SOFAR and other groups have expressed concern that some of the freeway 

        construction in outlying, unincorporated areas in the county included 

        in SANDAG's transportation plan would subsidize and induce sprawl at the 

        fringe of the metropolitan area, thus prolonging a decades-long trend 

        of metropolitan area expansion more rapid than population growth. </p>

      <p> SOFAR and other groups believe rapid, increasingly low density, leap-frog 

        metro area expansion fuels traffic congestion, higher and higher housing 

        costs, contamination of drinking water, and pollution of beaches. These 

        groups have criticized SANDAG's transportation plan for not adequately 

        considering these impacts. </p>

      <p> In exchange for SOFAR agreeing not to challenge SANDAG's plan in court, 

        SANDAG agreed to conduct a formal analysis of an "alternative" transportation 

        network. Involving a $510 million shift, the "alternative" would substitute 

        more frequent service on two existing urban routes and add two new urban 

        routes. </p>

      <p> "This is a great example of how SANDAG and activist groups concerned 

        with the quality of life in San Diego can work together towards a common 

        end of containing sprawl. We are confident SANDAG's analysis will show 

        that these transit investments will improve the quality of life, mobility, 

        and property values of more residents of the San Diego region, than will 

        the freeways built at the edge of the region," said Duncan McFetridge, 

        SOFAR's chairman. "Indeed, we believe freeways at the edge will cause 

        far more harm than good." </p>
