    <TD> <p>GP 2020, the County&#8217;s land use blueprint for the next twenty 

        years, is due to be adopted by the Board of Supervisors soon. For the 

        County this is another defining moment. Having failed once before to draft 

        and implement a responsible (and legal) land use plan and rejecting (and 

        actually campaigning against) Proposition B, the Board of Supervisors 

        now has a second chance to earn the &#8220;smart growth&#8221; credentials 

        it so publicly advertises by declaring an interim moratorium on all new 

        development until GP 2020 is adopted. </p>

      <p>The reasons why a moratorium is necessary are the hundreds of &#8220;vested&#8221; 

        commercial and residential projects already in the planning pipeline that 

        stand to be approved regardless of their non-conformity to the new plan. 

        These projects, which will litter the backcountry with big box retail 

        stores, supermarkets, strip malls, and housing tracts, are to smart growth 

        what glassy-winged sharpshooters are to this year&#8217;s grape harvest. 

      </p>

      <p>Their impact on our county&#8217;s natural and economic resources would 

        be devastating. California Government Code section 65858 authorizes city 

        or county government to prohibit the issuance of building permits while 

        it is in the process of updating its general plan. Such an interim ordinance, 

        adopted recently by local governments in Tiburon, San Juan Capistrano, 

        and Sutter and Orange Counties, is intended only to prevent conflicts 

        between new development entitlements based on current land use plans and 

        contemplated changes to those plans. </p>

      <p>In effect, a moratorium suspends the planned destruction of our backcountry 

        and allows public input to secure, in the words of the ordinance, &#8220;the 

        public health, safety, and welfare.&#8221; Responsible action, starting 

        with a moratorium ordinance the supervisors are legally authorized to 

        impose, is needed now to protect the county&sup1;s ability to accommodate 

        recently approved development as it formulates strategies to address the 

        series of countywide problems that take turns in local headlines&#8249;from 

        sewage and pollution control to traffic to water and power distribution. 

      </p>

      <p>To encourage the Board of Supervisors to make the necessary findings 

        pursuant to such an ordinance, Save Our Forest and Ranchlands has invited 

        local planning and sponsor groups to call on the supervisors to suspend 

        the issuance of permits until GP 2020 is adopted. With no valid reason 

        not to introduce a building moratorium and ample legal precedent to do 

        so, the Board of Supervisors might at last decide that the right thing 

        to do is also the legal thing, and vice versa. <br>
