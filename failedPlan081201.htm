      <p><strong>August 12, 2001</strong> </p>

      <p>When a city such as San Diego, Chula Vista or Encinitas considers planning 

        and zoning for a community, it doesn't just ask landowners and builders 

        what they want. Cities consider what's best for the entire community, 

        including impacts on traffic, the environment, quality of life and character 

        of neighborhoods. </p>

      <p>Otherwise, we might have convenience stores in the middle of residential 

        blocks, industrial warehouses next to condominiums or office buildings 

        on neighborhood streets. </p>

      <p>While most elected city leaders and city planning departments understand 

        that the wishes of property owners can't take precedence over the good 

        of the community, the county Board of Supervisors and the county Department 

        of Planning and Land Use have never understood it. </p>

      <p>Over and over since the 1970s, the county has undertaken major planning 

        efforts for backcountry land. Over and over, courts have struck down these 

        plans because they didn't take into account the impacts on traffic, the 

        environment, air quality, water resources, etc. Instead, county supervisors 

        and county planners accommodated the wishes of landowners while virtually 

        ignoring how backcountry residential and agricultural development would 

        affect the rest of the county and the invaluable natural resources. </p>

      <p>The county wasted millions of taxpayer dollars developing and unsuccessfully 

        defending these deficient backcountry plans against lawsuits by Save Our 

        Forests and Ranchlands (SOFAR). About a month ago, the county dropped 

        its appeal of the latest court ruling against the latest county plan, 

        this after county supervisors and planners swore they had finally gotten 

        it right. The county has been sent back to the drawing board yet again; 

        the judge ordered officials to rescind their latest backcountry plan. 

      </p>

      <p>After the county's losing streak began a decade ago, a judge turned over 

        backcountry land-use authority to SOFAR because the county was failing 

        its public mandate to plan and zone private land. Incredibly, this small, 

        nonprofit conservation group now controls all decisions on building permits 

        and other matters for 250,000 acres of privately owned agricultural and 

        natural land. This may be unprecedented in the nation, and should be humiliating 

        to county supervisors and planners. </p>

      <p>After this latest defeat, the people of San Diego County should demand 

        that the Board of Supervisors finally produce an honest plan for the backcountry, 

        one that doesn't fundamentally alter its current rural and natural character 

        and that forthrightly examines the real environmental impacts of land-use 

        changes. Unless supervisors want SOFAR making backcountry decisions forever, 

        they must recognize that their policy of indulging the wishes of backcountry 

        landowners and builders, at the expense of the rest of the county and 

        the environment, is both a legal failure and a land-use failure.<br>
