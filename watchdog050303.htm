  	<TD><p>The Clean Water and Forest Initiative Committee is coordinating a massive 

        signature gathering campaign in order to qualify a Clean Water and Forest 

        Initiative for the March 2004 ballot. They need your help -- volunteers 

        will be required to collect the signatures of over 100,000 registered 

        voters.</p>

      <p>The initiative will protect San Diego County's wilderness and open space 

        lands by amending the county General Plan to require voter approval before 

        certain lands in the north and east county can be developed for intensive 

        urban uses.</p>

      <p> Without this safeguard in place, San Diego County will slowly go the 

        way of Los Angeles -- pavement from ocean to desert, mountains to valleys; 

        a nightmare of urban sprawl and ecological destruction. We can't let this 

        happen!</p>

      <p> San Diego County open space needs your help! This email has been sent 

        to you because you are a representative of an activist or environmental 

        organization. Please forward this information to anyone that could help 

        us. More importantly, please consider volunteering at least a couple hours 

        per week.</p>

      <p> We need 100,000 signatures by September 12. It's a daunting task, but 

        it's possible. You could help make it happen. </p>

      <p>For more information, or to volunteer, contact The Clean Water and Forest 

        Initiative Committee at (619) 702-5470, or send email to CWFI@nethere.com.</p>

      <p>Thanks for helping to make San Diego County a better place to live. </p>
