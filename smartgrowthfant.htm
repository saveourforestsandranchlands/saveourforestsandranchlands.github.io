        <strong>Talking &#8216;Smart Growth,&#8217; doing nothing</strong></p>

      <p>By Duncan McFetridge</p>

      <p>Imagine living in a county in which elected officials are so controlled 

        by developer interests that a judge removes the county's authority over 

        hundreds of thousands of acres of rural lands and orders the county to 

        clean up its act. </p>

      <p>&quot;Submit a new plan that meets state law,&quot; this courageous judge 

        declares, &quot;and you county supervisors and planners can reclaim your 

        privilege to administer these lands.&quot; </p>

      <p>Then imagine that rather than rushing to meet the judge's six-month deadline, 

        the Board of Supervisors and their lawyers spend more than $2 million 

        over five years to fight the court by developing three consecutive &quot;new&quot; 

        plans, each one of which, worse than the other, is bounced into the planning 

        trash can by the judge. </p>

      <p>With the final plan negatively impacting 200,000 acres of watershed, 

        threatening the region's drinking water supply, and bringing in the state 

        attorney general against the county, the judge finds that the county utterly 

        fails to meet state laws that would protect the most biologically diverse 

        wildlands contained in a single county within the continental United States. 

      </p>

      <p>There's more. </p>

      <p>After the judge's most recent ruling, the county supervisors again choose 

        courtroom wrangling over compliance with state law. They are taking their 

        appeal to the state's higher court s, hoping they can rehabilitate policies 

        that will spread suburbs and malls into the backcountry. </p>

      <p>Incredible, right? It's no fantasy. By now, you've guessed that I'm talking 

        about San Diego County, from 1996 right up to today. </p>

      <p>What makes this a quintessential San Diegan dream-like, inside-out, upside-down 

        story is that instead of responding with solutions to the public's growing 

        alarm at traffic gridlock, beach pollution, housing costs, decaying infrastructure 

        and special interests' control of government, the supervisors squander 

        county money and employee hours on &quot;smart growth&quot; seminars and 

        symposia held monthly around the county. </p>

      <p>What is this &quot;smart growth&quot; that is staged San Diego-style 

        and supported by the same elected officials who repeatedly go to the mat 

        for big developers? We've heard a lot about smart growth recently, but 

        are given few clues to help us tell the difference between sound planning 

        and empty rhetoric. </p>

      <p>We should start by making a distinction between what the county says 

        and what the county does. In theory, smart growth emphasizes protecting 

        watersheds, wildlands and ranches by concentrating new and redeveloped 

        housing in existing urban areas near places of work. It calls for investing 

        in public transit and improving urban services to make cities livable 

        and affordable. But, as pointed out above, county officials have, for 

        nearly six years, repeatedly resisted a court injunction to plan legally 

        and soundly. </p>

      <p>This history is reason, by itself, to have little faith in the county's 

        ability to act as steward of our land. And there should be great concern 

        over the county's recently unveiled 2020 plan. </p>

      <p>If the county refuses the court's order to properly plan for the 200,000 

        acres of watershed, how can we trust it with nearly 500,000 acres of rural 

        lands? In fact, the planning department is currently processing hundreds 

        of projects that will convert thousands of acres of farm and rural lands 

        into subdivisions and strip malls in East County, even while it talks 

        smart growth. Incredibly, the county is attempting to sell a 2020 plan 

        that spreads sprawl onto our rural lands and even tries to undo an overwhelmingly 

        popular initiative protecting the Cleveland National Forest. </p>

      <p>Is there any wonder that the county's clean water conference was boycotted 

        by all the major environmental groups in San Diego? The conference met 

        to discuss ways to protect San Diego's streams, rivers, reservoirs and 

        the watersheds that feed them. At stake are not only the reservoirs that 

        store imported water but also a large portion of the locally produced 

        water San Diegans drink. But the Sierra Club, the Environmental Health 

        Coalition, Audubon Society, Surfrider and Baykeeper reasonably thought 

        that a government that has been acting to destroy these same watersheds 

        and our beaches has no credibility at all. </p>

      <p>We need to wake up from this bad dream and realize that we have no county 

        elected officials with the integrity to resist the building industries' 

        pressures. We can't count on them to do the right thing just because they 

        sprinkle themselves with a little smart-growth pixie dust. </p>

      <p>What we can do is: </p>

      <ul>

        <li> Insist that our elected officials stop stalling on complying with 

          state and federal laws. The county should not be appealing -- for the 

          nth time -- the Superior Court's ruling on its illegal general plan 

          and rezoning. <br>

        </li>

        <li> Demand that the Board of Supervisors enforce an urban limit line 

          immediately. There is no such line in General Plan 2020. In fact, the 

          plan eliminates regional planning categories, and thus, existing distinctions 

          between urban, rural and wild areas. <br>

        </li>

        <li> Tell the supervisors to stop the election year posturing and get 

          moving on an environmentally sound and legal general plan. If the county 

          planning department is not up to the task, its top staff should resign. 

          <br>

        </li>

        <li> Demand that the county declare a moratorium on large-scale subdivisions 

          and commercial projects -- supermarket malls -- at the urban-rural fringe. 

          Only real estate speculators want these projects. <br>

        </li>

        <li> Tell the county to stop calling handholding conferences and get to 

          work with other public officials and build a community that benefits 

          all its citizens. We've known what to do for 20 years. </li>

      </ul>

      <p>Let's stop talking smart growth and do it.<br>
