      <blockquote>High Country News is an excellent journal that reports on the events 

        and challenges facing conservation and protection of the environment in 

        the West. Published by a group of committed people in a small town on 

        the western slope of the Colorado Rockies, HCN is a great way to stay 

        informed on the issues facing all of us that are concerned with the fate 

        of our threatened wildlands, rangelands, wildlife, and way of life of 

        our rural communities.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>For thirty years, High Country News has reported on the West's natural 

        resources, public lands, wildlife and changing communities. HCN's award-winning 

        bi-weekly coverage describes the West as it is and points the way to what 

        it can be. Founded in 1970 by Wyoming rancher, teacher, and biologist, 

        Tom Bell, High Country News has stayed loyal to its mission of informing 

        and inspiring people to act on behalf of the West's natural environment 

        and human communities It is HCN's goal to help the West achieve the dream 

        of the late Wallace Stegner, who envisioned a &quot;society to match the 

        scenery.&quot; Visit HCN's web site (www.hcn.org) to sample back issues
