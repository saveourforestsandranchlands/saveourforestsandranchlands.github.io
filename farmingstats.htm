    <TD> <p>In July the California Farm Bureau entered an Amicus Brief in support 

        of the County of San Diego and in opposition to the position held by SOFAR. 

      </p>

      <p>We, SOFAR, as defenders of the backcountry and the plaintiffs in this 

        case, have to ask of the Farm Bureau, the so-called guardians of farms 

        and the agricultural industry, Why do you get involved now?</p>

      <p>Consider the devastation to agriculture in the County while you have 

        remained motionless:</p>

      <ul>

        <li> <em>Since 1984, San Diego County has endured the loss of 30,000 acres 

          of its farmland.</em><br>

          <br>

        </li>

        <li> <em>We&#8217;ve been ranked in the top 10 state counties suffering 

          the loss of significant acreages of its irrigated agricultural lands 

          for 8 years. <br>

          </em><br>

        </li>

        <li> <em>Farms of every size have been decreasing in numbers of acreages, 

          even though the value of the crops produced skyrocketed.* <br>

          </em><br>

        </li>

        <li> <em>Development pressures adjacent to farms have pushed farmers out 

          of business, threatening the very viability of remaining farms in rural 

          areas with land speculation and conversion of use. </em> <br></ul>

          

          <p>*due to the proliferation of ornamental crops which bring a higher dollar-value 

          but which feed none. </pr>

          <p>

          General Plan Amendment 96-03 as currently put forward, and allegedly 

          for the expansion and benefit of small farming in the County, is a total 

          failure. </p>

          <ul>

        </li>

        <li><em> The County supposes that farming that is currently unsuccessful 

          in areas with irrigation and service will be successful further out 

          into the backcountry.</em> <br>

          <br>

        </li>

        <li> <em>In GPA 96-03, the County proposes to eliminate agriculture as 

          a required Element in the General Plan thereby leaving 300,000 acres 

          of cropland outside agricultural preserves with no substantial protection. 

          Today thousands of acres of productive cropland are in the planning 

          stages, slated for development. Have you nothing to say about these? 

          </em><br>

          <br>

        </li>

        <li> <em>Without an Agricultural Element to protect agriculture west of 

          the County Water Authority, there is no guarantee that the conversion 

          of grazing lands will turn into small farm agriculture as the County 

          claims because they&#8217;re encouraging conversion of ag lands in areas 

          with irrigation and services. </em><br>

        </li>

      </ul>

      <ul>

        <li> <em>Assumption of total clearing over the land doesn&#8217;t benefit 

          farming interests but it does lay the foundation for future development 

          of ranchettes. </em><br>

          <br>

        </li>

        <li> <em>The lack of environmental review for farming and clearing the 

          land is another method of the County shirking its duty to direct the 

          use of the land in responsible manner. The County shifts the responsibility 

          for environmental safeguards upon the farmer as a result of its own 

          inability to plan effectively for the benefit of the region.</em></li>

      </ul>

      <p>If, as your brief suggests, you think that the plan for San Diego&#8217;s 

        agricultural lands will be a model for other counties in the state, SOFAR 

        is concerned about where your true loyalties lie, for the deterioration 

        in quality and number of agricultural lands and their diversity does not 

        bode well for the sustainability of the industry.</p>

      <p>Witness San Diego County&#8217;s dismal record over the last 20 years 

        and it becomes evident that the real problem lies in the failure of leadership 

        to ensure the long term viability and productivity of farming in San Diego. 

        Could this be what the Farm Bureau envisions for the state?</p>
