  	<TD><p><strong><u>An Invitation</u></strong></p>

      <blockquote>SOFAR will be participating at the &quot;Sierra Club Land Use Forum&quot; 

        that will be held at the USD College of Law on February 26th from 7:00pm 

        to 9:00pm. The forum will be held in the Grace Courtroom, which is located 

        on the third floor of Warren Hall. (Warren Hall is near the intersection 

        of Linda Vista Road and Via Las Cumbres.) Other presenters will include 

        The Surfrider Foundation and The Audubon Society. Participants will explain 

        the import of their current environmental litigation to be followed by 

        questions and answers. SOFAR will be making the case that its General 

        Plan Lawsuits demonstrate the systematic theft of public resources by 

        local politicians. We anticipate an educational and entertaining evening, 

        and welcome all of SOFAR's supporters to join us.</blockquote>

      <p><strong><u>SOFAR Still Needs An Intern!</u></strong></p>

      <blockquote>Help contribute to one of the most successful activist group in San Diego&#8212;SOFAR 

        needs help maintaining its project database. This is an on-going assignment 

        that helps us to continue our role as watchdog of San Diego&#8217;s backcountry. 

        We need an intern who is available every week to coordinate with Duncan 

        on significant projects so we can keep our supporters and other interested 

        persons up-to-date with the deluge of development happening in our area. 

        Outside of the government planning departments, SOFAR is the only group 

        maintaining such a list of significant projects online. This is an especially 

        good opportunity for planning students or others interested in learning 

        more about local planning. Call Duncan at 619-230-1963 if you are interested 

        in helping us in this task.</blockquote>
