      <p>PLANNING COMMISSION TO VOTE ON LAND-USE ISSUE </p>

      <p>AFFECTING 200,000 ACRES OF BACKCOUNTRY FARMLAND</p>

      <p>San Diego &#8211; The most important land-use decision affecting the 

        backcountry of San Diego since the Forest Conservation Initiative will 

        go before the Planning Commission tomorrow, March 3, 2000 at a hearing 

        to begin at 9 am. This vote will determine the fate of over 200,000 acres 

        of Agricultural Preserve (Ag 20) open space and farmlands. It will also 

        determine whether urban sprawl will engulf the backcountry with I-15 traffic 

        all the way to Julian, or whether we will preserve our valuable and irreplaceable 

        Agricultural Preserve (Ag 20) lands.</p>

      <p>The County&#8217;s project, GPA 96-03, is the response to SOFAR&#8217;s 

        lawsuit against the County for not adopting an Agriculture Element and 

        not properly zoning our Agricultural Preserve lands. The Superior Court 

        ruled that the General Plan was missing a mandatory Agriculture Element 

        and the urban zoning of 8-acre minimum lot size set by the County for 

        Agricultural Preserve (Ag 20) lands was illegal. All subdivision activity 

        and issuance of building permits was stopped.</p>

      <p>GPA 96-03, as proposed by the County, allows 10-acre minimum lot sizes 

        for Ag 20 lands west of the CWA infrastructure line. Ag 20 lands east 

        of the CWA infrastructure line would have a 40-acre minimum lot size or 

        a 10-acre minimum lot size if it can be demonstrated that there is evidence 

        of adequate soils, topography, and water availability to support the proposed 

        agriculture.</p>

      <p>The County&#8217;s own Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for GPA 96-03 

        assumes complete clearing of the 200,000 acres of Agricultural Preserve 

        (Ag 20) farmlands. The EIR finds significant impacts to Traffic, Water 

        Resources, Visual Quality/Aesthetics, Cultural/Paleontological, Geological 

        Issues, Noise, and Air Quality. This assumption of complete clearing of 

        the backcountry is not done to facilitate agriculture; this is a mascarade 

        for the complete development of San Diego&#8217;s backcountry. The lot 

        size minimums proposed by the County will not support agriculture. Instead, 

        these lot size minimums invite ranchette development.</p>

      <p>SOFAR&#8217;s Alternative for GPA 96-03 is:<br>

        The County of San Diego adopt an Agriculture Element to our General Plan 

        to cover several hundred thousand acres of irrigated cropland west of 

        the County Water Authority (CWA) infrastructure line.</p>

      <p>Adopt lot size minimums for Agriculture Preserve (Ag 20) farmlands and 

        open space of 80 acres east of the CWA infrastructure line, 40 acres west 

        of the CWA line, and 10 acres for prime farmland west of the CWA line.</p>

      <p>This alternative meets the requirements of the Williamson Act, for which 

        these lands are set aside, and the need to preserve our backcountry Agricultural 

        Preserve (Ag 20) open space and farmlands. These Agricultural Preserve 

        lands are vital to our quality of life and the future of San Diego County. 

        The vote at tomorrow&#8217;s Planning Commission hearing will determine 

        what type of backcountry we will leave to our children and future generations 

        of San Diegans.</p>

      <p>The Planning Commission hearing will take place tomorrow, March 3, 2000 

        at 9 am in the Planning Commission Hearing Room at the Department of Planning 

        &amp; Land Use at 5201 Ruffin Road, San Diego.<br>
