      <p><br>

        Dear Mr. Pryor, </p>

      <p> We sincerely appreciate the opportunity to comment on the DEIR report 

        for &quot;Agricultural Issues General Plan Amendment and Implementing 

        Rezone.&quot; This rezoning project will have long-term effects on the 

        future of agriculture, residential development and on the biodiversity 

        in San Diego County. The comments made in this report stem from our collective 

        knowledge as scientists working on issues of biological diversity and 

        conservation and do not reflect the opinions of our employers or our sponsoring 

        institutions. </p>

      <p><strong>I. Executive summary</strong> </p>

      <p> County land currently designated as Agricultural-20, &quot;(20) lands&quot;, 

        currently function as healthy ecosystems, with nearly 85% of the vegetation 

        in them intact. A large number of threatened and endangered species exist 

        on these areas. In addition, the spatial arrangement of (20) lands within 

        the county makes them critical areas connecting state and federally owned 

        reserves, so they also play a vital role in county-wide persistence of 

        larger organisms. The current plan and the proposed alternatives all will 

        have substantial, negative impacts on biodiversity in (20) lands and on 

        their ability to support animal movements across regions of the county. 

        The impacts fall into four categories: habitat loss, habitat fragmentation, 

        impacts on riparian areas, and changes in fire regimes. Habitat loss will 

        be substantial, directly impacting the number of species in (20) lands. 

        None of the plans incorporate methods of conserving some of the rarer 

        habitat types that are found primarily on (20) land. Habitat fragmentation, 

        with its associated edge effects and increased number of roads, will decrease 

        the ability of (20) lands to support larger species, increase the rates 

        of invasion by some exotic species, and will also limit the ability of 

        organisms to move across larger areas of the county. A lack of movement 

        could impact the regional persistence of some organisms and alter the 

        population genetic structure of others. Increased levels of run-off, soil 

        erosion, and the depletion of ground water will impact riparian systems. 

        Finally, increased human densities in (20) lands increases the risk of 

        human suffering and property loss in the face of a fire-adapted ecosystem. 

        Fire suppression will increase habitat fragmentation and loss, and will 

        alter natural burn rates that maintain fire-adapted plant communities. 

      </p>

      <p> No alternatives were evaluated that attempted to zone land in a manner 

        that reduces the secondary impacts of agriculture and residential dwellings 

        on the natural heritage of San Diego County while increasing agricultural 

        use. Indeed, the alternatives chosen lacked any integration of biological 

        and agricultural considerations. Furthermore, the countywide impacts of 

        changes in (20) lands were not fully explored in the DEIR. We urge the 

        County Board of Supervisors to select alternative plan #3. Although creating 

        negative impacts, the 80-acre parcel size plan, among the alternatives, 

        will have the smallest impact on native biodiversity, and have the greatest 

        chance of maintaining the connectivity currently associated with (20) 

        land. </p>

      <p><strong>I. Introduction</strong> </p>

      <p> Scientists studying declines in biodiversity agree that San Diego County 

        is in the midst of a biological crisis. The county, as a part of S. California, 

        contains a greater diversity of vertebrates and endemic species than any 

        other region in the United States. Because of this rich diversity, urban 

        expansion and the associated loss of habitat has resulted in a large number 

        of endangered species and entire ecosystems at risk of extirpation within 

        the county. Given this degraded state of natural systems in San Diego 

        County, we feel land use planning should incorporate sound conservation 

        practices focused on maintaining the unique biological diversity and natural 

        heritage of the county. The current rezoning plan for (20) lands described 

        in the DEIR &quot;Agricultural Issues General Plan Amendment and Implementing 

        Rezone&quot; does not include any attempts to zone (20) land in a manner 

        that facilitates sound conservation of biodiversity. Furthermore, the 

        DEIR 1) inadequately describes the potential negative impacts the proposed 

        plan and the alternatives will have on regional biodiversity and 2) does 

        not analyze changes to (20) lands in regard to their impacts on county-wide 

        conservation. </p>

      <p><strong>II. Potential negative effects of the proposed rezones on native 

        biodiversity</strong> </p>

      <p> (20) lands play an important and perhaps vital role in local biodiversity 

        for two reasons. First, they cover large areas of the county. These large 

        areas include a number of rare habitat types that support unique species. 

        For example, over 80% of acacia scrub, 60% of alkali marsh, and 85% of 

        Coast range, Klamath, and Peninsular Coniferous forest occur in (20) lands. 

        The large areas also link both current and proposed federal and state 

        conservation areas. Second, most (20) land (83%) is still healthy and 

        functioning as &quot;primarily native habitat&quot; (p. 2-68). Thus, (20) 

        lands continue to support a large number of native plant and animals. 

        Given the decline of habitats in other parts of the county, the conservation 

        value of these lands is great and not yet lost. In fact, these areas support 

        species that are highly sensitive to disturbance such as mountain lions, 

        golden eagles and ringtails. </p>

      <p> The general plan amendment describes six scenarios with different combinations 

        of parcel sizes that result in a range of population densities and farming 

        or ranching intensities. All of these scenarios would result in more dwellings 

        and more agriculture in (20) lands than what currently exists. The DEIR 

        describes, generally, the potential impacts of rezoning on biological 

        resources and indicates that there is no feasible mitigation measure identified 

        for any of them. The DEIR assumes that plans allowing more agriculture 

        and higher populations will have greater impacts on biological resources. 

        As such, the DEIR suggests no plan would have the smallest impact, followed 

        by Alt #3, then #1, #2, #5 and #4. We agree with this general assessment. 

      </p>

      <p> However, the lack of detail in the DEIR fails to underscore the potentially 

        massive negative impacts the rezoning plan will have on biodiversity in 

        (20) lands and potentially on other areas of the county. Though the DEIR 

        describes potential impacts of the rezoning, it does not fully describe 

        the likely negative impacts caused by the alternatives. Furthermore the 

        DEIR does not address the potentially large differences in impacts between 

        the alternatives nor offer alternatives that lessen these impacts. Furthermore, 

        the DEIR does not address larger, countywide impacts of the proposed rezoning 

        on efforts to conserve biological diversity. </p>

      <p><strong>Four impacts of the proposed plan</strong> </p>

      <p> There are four major impacts the rezoning plans will have on the biological 

        systems in (20) lands. They are 1) Loss of habitat, 2) Habitat fragmentation, 

        3) Impacts on riparian systems and wetlands, and 4) Fire. If the alternative 

        plans were analyzed in terms of these four impacts, a more comprehensive 

        picture would have emerged. These are discussed below. </p>

      <p><em>1) Loss of habitat and habitat quality.</em><br>

        Those alternatives creating smaller parcel sizes will result in 1) more 

        residential homes and 2) more intensive agriculture. Both of these activities 

        will reduce the amount and quality of native habitat relative to current 

        land use. </p>

      <p> Ecologists recognize a fully supported positive relationship between 

        the number of species in an area and the size of that area. Larger areas 

        support more species. It follows from this relationship that as (20) lands 

        are converted from native habitat, native biodiversity will decline across 

        the area. The relationship exists because all species need some minimum 

        area of land in order to survive. In the case of (20) lands, habitat loss 

        will first affect larger-bodied species with large space use needs such 

        as mountain lions and bobcats. However, small parcel sizes, like those 

        found in all of the alternatives, will result in conversion of large percentages 

        of the acreage in each parcel. Alternative #3, with larger, 80 acre parcels, 

        may be the only exception. As such, the degree of habitat loss will most 

        likely impact many species, particularly those found in rare habitats. 

        Rare habitats, because of their small size, will be lost more quickly 

        than more common habitat types. Thus, under nearly all of the proposed 

        plans we expect to see a smaller percentage of native habitat remaining 

        and severe drops in the number of species a particular piece of (20) land 

        supports. The DEIR does not predict the amount of native habitat remaining 

        after build-out and increased agriculture for any of the plans. This information 

        is needed to predict impacts on the number of species expected in future 

        (20) lands. </p>

      <p> In addition to habitat loss, increased human populations in (20) land 

        will degrade the quality of any remaining native habitats. Besides conversion 

        of native habitats, humans alter the ability of habitats to support species 

        by assorted activities ranging from introducing invasive species, to children 

        with BB guns, to owning cats and dogs, to creating trails. Some of these 

        activities are fairly innocuous on their own, but collectively, they can 

        have large cumulative effects. For example, the rate of spread of invasive 

        species increases with human presence. Fire ants have recently been discovered 

        in SD county. Their spread is associated with plant containers found in 

        nurseries. Smaller parcel sizes will increase the number of nursery operations, 

        likely increasing the rate and extent of the fire ant invasion. This spread 

        will negatively impact native ecosystems and have costly impacts on more 

        traditional agriculture in (20) lands. Humans also subsidize two domestic 

        predators of native animals (dogs and cats). A study of 78 domestic cats 

        in England found they killed 1100 small mammals and birds in one year. 

        If we assume one cat per house in (20) lands (a reasonable estimate as 

        some farms/homes will have &gt;1) and predatory rates similar to those 

        in England, then the domestic cat population created by the six (20) alternatives 

        will kill between 68,000 to 175,000 small mammals and birds ANNUALLY. 

        These mortality rates could negatively impact the structure and dynamics 

        of more frequently preyed upon species, altering community structure and 

        patterns of energy flow through food webs. </p>

      <p> Given a decline in biodiversity with habitat loss and a reduction in 

        habitat quality, the rezoning plan should realize that some habitat types 

        are unique or rare. Table 2.6-2 (p. 2-71) notes 64 different native habitat 

        types that exist within (20) lands. The DEIR indicates that &quot;there 

        is potential for most of the 64 native vegetation communities to be significantly 

        impacted by development, from agricultural or increased residential uses, 

        of land as a secondary consequence of this project.&quot; In 16 cases, 

        over 20% the vegetation type in the county occurs in (20) lands. In 4 

        cases, over 60% of the habitat type is found only in (20) lands. These 

        habitats play an important role in maintaining regional biodiversity. 

        A unit loss in these rarer vegetation types is not equal to a unit loss 

        in other habitat types. Any rezoning plan should realize the value of 

        these unique habitats and zone land accordingly. </p>

      <p> For example, many of the areas currently designated as (20) are grasslands 

        used for cattle grazing. These grasslands dominate (20) land north east 

        of Escondido while large areas are also found west of Santa Ysabel Indian 

        Reservation, northeast of Ramona, and in the Jamul-Duluzra area. These 

        grasslands support large numbers of small mammals and are vital for sustaining 

        local raptor populations as well as migratory raptors. In addition, the 

        grasslands contain unique and rare plants that may be capable of surviving 

        reasonable grazing levels, but not tilled soils. If plot sizes are reduced 

        to ten acres in these areas, land previously grazed will be either tilled 

        or converted into 10-acre estates, or greenhouses. This will extirpate 

        populations of unique plant species and drastically reduce small mammal 

        populations, thereby reducing the abundance of raptors. These grasslands 

        should be given conservation value when determining parcels sizes and 

        the level of agriculture allowed. The DEIR makes no such recommendations. 

      </p>

      <p> Though the DEIR does not predict the amounts of habitat lost by the 

        different alternatives, it is easy to conclude that alternatives with 

        small parcel sizes will result in much higher levels of habitat loss that 

        alternatives with larger parcel sizes. Smaller parcel sizes not only result 

        in more farms or homes; they also result in more intensive forms of agriculture, 

        such as greenhouse operations or poultry egg farms. These forms of agriculture 

        will probably destroy a larger proportion of a parcel than would agriculture 

        on 80-acre parcels (alternative #3), which is more likely to be grazing. 

        Thus, in terms of habitat loss, alternative #3 will have much lower levels 

        than would any of the other alternatives, particularly alternatives #4 

        and #5. </p>

      <p><em>2) Habitat Fragmentation.</em><br>

        Habitat fragmentation is the conversion of once continuous areas into 

        a mosaic consisting of patches of the original habitat surrounded by a 

        matrix of lower quality or disturbed habitat. Low levels of fragmentation 

        probably have little impact on biodiversity or on the population dynamics 

        of most species, because most natural systems have some degree of inherent 

        habitat patchiness. However, landscape ecologists and conservation biologists 

        have shown that higher levels or larger scales of habitat fragmentation 

        lead to drastic declines in the abundances of most species. These declines 

        in abundance ultimately cause extinctions of populations on the remaining 

        patches and eventual extirpation of a species from an entire area. In 

        addition, some species require more than one habitat type to complete 

        their life (most amphibians live on land, but reproduce in water). In 

        these cases, habitat fragmentation can eliminate the ability of a species 

        to move between habitats. Thus, fragmented habitats generally support 

        fewer native species and less intact ecosystems then their continuous 

        counterparts. </p>

      <p> Recent work indicates that as habitats become fragmented, the decline 

        in the abundance of a species or in the total number of species is not 

        a simple linear decay relating to the amount of remaining habitat. Instead, 

        a threshold exists for some species or systems so that once a certain 

        level of fragmentation exists, abundance drops sharply, as does the number 

        of species in a system. Given the linear pattern of (20) lands in major 

        valleys and the extent of these lands in the county, development of these 

        lands as small parcels would almost certainly exceed this threshold, causing 

        drastic loss of species. </p>

      <p><em>Edge effects.</em><br>

        Habitat fragmentation also results in a myriad of changes in ecological 

        processes along the edges of the fragments - collectively known as &quot;edge 

        effects.&quot; Songbirds living on the edges of fragments often experience 

        higher rates of nest predation from species that forage along forest edges 

        (i.e. raccoons, cats, and squirrels) and increased rates of nest parasitism 

        by brown-headed cowbirds. Collectively, these effects make successfully 

        reproduction unlikely in some songbird species throughout S. Illinois, 

        an area in which forests have been cleared and fragmented by agriculture. 

        A similar situation could occur in (20) lands for the endangered Southwestern 

        willow flycatcher and Least bill vireo as both species are parasitized 

        by cowbirds and sustain nest predation. In addition, edge effects are 

        often associated with increased invasions by exotic species. In (20) lands, 

        increased agriculture will result in higher levels of irrigation. Additional 

        water, especially in arid regions, may sustain populations of invasive 

        species such as the Argentine ant. These impacts would be even more likely 

        if the alternatives with smaller parcel sizes are adopted. </p>

      <p><em>Roads.</em><br>

        Within any area of land designated as (20), smaller lot sizes will result 

        in more residential dwellings and farming. These activities will result 

        in more roads. Roads have direct and negative impacts on many terrestrial 

        organisms. They were the major cause of mountain lion mortality in a study 

        conducted by one of us (P. Beier) in the Santa Ana Mountains. A study 

        in Wisconsin indicates even low densities of roads makes death by automobiles 

        the primary cause of mortality in wolves. Automobile deaths reduce the 

        abundances of snakes near roads in the Everglades. Evidence suggests that 

        increased roads would result in increased levels of mortality for nearly 

        all mobile animals in (20) lands, including nearly all terrestrial vertebrates 

        (mammals, reptiles, amphibians). </p>

      <p><em>Habitat fragmentation across larger areas of the county.</em><br>

        The location of the (20) lands within the county must also be considered. 

        Changes within units of land designated as (20) may diminish regional, 

        countywide connectivity between larger areas of land. Scientists have 

        shown that the movement of individuals between populations affects population 

        dynamics and rates of extinction. In some species, including mountain 

        lions in S. California, movement between populations is critical to regional 

        survival. The DEIR points out that &quot;secondary impacts could occur 

        to migration corridors of sensitive species&quot; (p. 2-99), but gives 

        few additional details. </p>

      <p> Currently, the national forests and state park land in central San Diego 

        County is in three large pieces described as &quot;Central Mountain&quot;, 

        &quot;North County Metro&quot;, and &quot;North Mountain&quot; in Figure 

        3-1 (p. 3-7). The proposed development and increased agriculture on (20) 

        lands north and west of Julian would create a barrier to movement between 

        the North Mountain region and the Central Mountain region. These particular 

        areas contain large parcels (500-999 acres, Figure 2.1-1, p. 2-119) that 

        keep this area less disturbed than would small plot sizes and more intensive 

        agriculture. By increasing human impacts in these areas, the (20) lands 

        may become unsuitable for many species and act as a barrier to movement 

        between the larger federal and state-owned lands on either side. This 

        could disrupt the movement of large carnivores (mountain lions and bobcats) 

        between the North and Central Mountain regions, diminishing their chances 

        of regional persistence. The region-wide fragmentation could also alter 

        the genetic structure of many smaller species by inhibiting movement. 

        In these species, genetic diversity is maintained over long time periods 

        by the multigenerational migration of genes across the landscape. It is 

        possible to determine what parcels of land in (20) areas act as vital 

        routes for animal movement. Once this information is determined, zoning 

        could be implemented that conserves these areas. </p>

      <p> Habitat fragmentation on (20) lands will have a myriad of negative effects, 

        and the potential for thresholds that could result in massive declines 

        in diversity if met or exceeded. Alternative #3, with the largest parcel 

        sizes, would have the least negative, but still substantial, impacts on 

        biodiversity and ecosystem function. </p>

      <p><em>3) Riparian corridors and wetlands.</em><br>

        Local streams and wetlands in San Diego County have already been severely 

        impacted by human development. Many streams are altered or dammed along 

        their course. These riparian corridors and wetlands support an array of 

        threatened and endangered species, as well as many endemics. Under current 

        law, these areas are not fully covered under the county's Habitat Conservation 

        Plans so they demand the utmost attention and need sound conservation 

        planning. A key point to consider is that many of the changes in (20) 

        lands will have impacts on riparian systems downstream, outside of (20) 

        zoning. These areas could be reservoirs that serve prime recreational 

        and drinking water functions, such as Otay Lake; or riparian corridors 

        that support endangered species, such as the San Luis Rey River. </p>

      <p> There are at least three ways in which increased agriculture can impact 

        these systems. First, as noted on page 2-36 of the DEIR, soil erosion 

        into streams will increase within the watersheds of (20) lands. Second, 

        aquatic systems within the drainage basins of (20) lands may have increased 

        levels of pesticides, herbicides and fertilizers. Third, groundwater could 

        be depleted. </p>

      <p> The increased flow of sediments and chemicals into these watersheds 

        can have large negative impacts. For example, increased siltation will 

        decrease reproduction in the endangered Arroyo Toad and alter the dynamics 

        of fish communities. Increased fertilizer run-off can lead to algal blooms 

        and eutrophic conditions, which kill fishes. Depletion of groundwater 

        can alter hydrological regimes in wetlands, resulting in changes in plant 

        communities within the wetlands and the loss of some species. </p>

      <p> The (20) lands east of Julian that abut Anza-Borrego Desert State Park 

        are a prime example of (20) lands that could impact a highly sensitive 

        area downstream. The Sentenac Cienaga is a unique desert wetland area 

        near Scissors Crossing. The area is a significant movement corridor for 

        the endangered peninsular desert bighorn sheep and is home to a large 

        number of rare plants and animals. California Department of Fish and Game 

        found this area unique and so valuable that they recently purchased additional 

        land near it. A large portion of the watershed for this wetland is (20) 

        land west of Scissors Crossing. The wetland area would be extremely sensitive 

        to chemical and soil runoff caused by tillage agriculture in the watershed. 

        In addition, groundwater depletion caused by increased agriculture could 

        alter hydrological patterns, drying out the wetland. (20) lands that have 

        the potential to impact areas such as the Sentenac Cienaga wetland should 

        be placed in a different zoning status than (20) lands in more buffered 

        watersheds. </p>

      <p> As with habitat loss and fragmentation, Alternative #3 would most likely 

        result in the smallest impacts on riparian systems. Alternative #3, by 

        keeping parcels large, reduces the intensity of agriculture per unit area, 

        reducing levels or run-off and ground water depletion. </p>

      <p><em>4) Fire.</em><br>

        One of the largest land use issues in San Diego County wildlands is recurrent 

        fire. Fire is integrated into the biology of the region and plant communities 

        such as coastal sage scrub and chapparal are fire adapted and require 

        occasional burns to maintain their structure and species composition. 

        On average, any piece of land in the county will be visited by a brushfire 

        twice a century. Under suppression management, these fires, if pushed 

        by Santa Ana winds or some other dry weather scenario, would be intense. 

        Increasing human populations in (20) lands will increase the chances of 

        property destruction and human loss without significant fire controls 

        on each property. As such, new buildings in (20) lands prone to fire will 

        have even greater footprints as areas are cleared around them. In addition, 

        a larger population in (20) lands would create even greater political 

        pressure to suppress fires, thus altering natural rates of burning that 

        maintain the structure and composition of the fire adapted plant communities. 

        Dispersed settlement, in any form, is the worst possible outcome of land 

        use rezoning in terms of fire. Furthermore, those alternatives that result 

        in higher densities of humans, further aggravate the situation. One solution 

        would be to develop concentrated communities that are more easily defendable. 

        No such alternative plan is suggested in the DEIR. </p>

      <p><strong>III. The impacts of the proposed changes on region-wide biodiversity</strong> 

      </p>

      <p> (20) lands are situated in unique areas within the county and, as discussed 

        above, play an important role in facilitating movement of species across 

        the region. In addition to this role, (20) lands support many sensitive 

        species (species considered threatened, endangered or rare by either the 

        federal government or the state of California). As such, a proportion 

        of the total, countywide population of each sensitive species is in (20) 

        lands. It is possible that large portions of the total population of a 

        sensitive species is in (20) land and could be extirpated under the proposed 

        zoning changes. </p>

      <p> Unfortunately, the DEIR did not describe or quantify the distribution, 

        abundance, or habitat preferences for the sensitive species in the (20) 

        lands. Furthermore, the DEIR did not predict the amounts of this habitat 

        that would be destroyed under specific alternatives and the resulting 

        spatial distributions. Without this information, it is difficult to assess 

        the impacts of the proposed plans on countywide persistence of sensitive 

        species. Decision-makers cannot understand the links between the habitat 

        types destroyed by the plans and the impacts of this destruction on sensitive 

        species. This lack of information has many ramifications. For example, 

        the DEIR failed to indicate how the alternative plans would impact, or 

        even preclude our ability to develop a successful habitat conservation 

        plan for the eastern portion of San Diego County. USFWS may not be as 

        willing to sign take permits if (20) land originally considered as having 

        conservation value for a species is now zoned for intensive agriculture 

        and small lot sizes. </p>

      <p> The (20) lands cover large areas in the East County. These areas will 

        be drastically altered by the proposed smaller parcel sizes, losing a 

        great deal of their potential to support threatened and endangered species. 

        Furthermore, (20) lands are spatially arranged so that large changes within 

        them could negatively impact the movement of wildlife between reserves 

        (current and proposed) throughout the county. Finally, (20) lands contain 

        large portions of unique and rare habitats that will not be protected 

        under the current proposals. Given these factors, we suggest that the 

        adoption of those (20) proposals with small parcel sizes and intense agriculture 

        could make it impossible to successful implement a habitat conservation 

        plan that successfully conserves the full range of threatened, endangered 

        or sensitive species in the east county. It may be possible that without 

        some (20) land intact, countywide persistence of some sensitive species 

        is unlikely. </p>

      <p> Without full knowledge of the relationship between habitat types and 

        sensitive species, decision-makers are left blind. How can they understand 

        potential future impacts of their decisions? They cannot make well informed 

        assessments regarding of the proposed plans on region-wide biodiversity 

        because they cannot gauge the impact of (20) zoning decisions on the recovery 

        of current sensitive species or on the potential for healthy species to 

        become threatened or endangered. </p>

      <p><strong>IV. Conclusions</strong> </p>

      <p> The current plan and the alternatives will all have negative impacts 

        on regions of San Diego county that are currently ~85% intact, support 

        many unique species, and function as fairly healthy ecosystems. Furthermore, 

        these impacts will go beyond the boundaries of (20) lands, impacting the 

        regional persistence of larger species and affecting riparian areas downstream. 

        The most disappointing aspect of the planning process and the DEIR is 

        the lack of creative attempts to develop alternatives that simultaneously 

        incorporate conservation, economic, and agricultural considerations. </p>

      <p> A first start would be to determine the maximum level of build-out that 

        does not have significant impacts on biological resources and use this 

        as a baseline to gauge additional plans. From this baseline, many creative 

        plans that incorporate economic, agriculture and conservation considerations 

        could have been developed and reviewed. For example, the DEIR could have 

        included a zoning plan that keeps large parcel sizes in grasslands and 

        riparian areas thus encouraging some degree of conservation by avoiding 

        intensive tillage or residential dwellings, while allowing smaller lot 

        sizes on less sensitive areas and prime agricultural areas. In addition, 

        special conservation easements in habitats supporting sensitive species 

        could have been presented. Because plans that included some attempt to 

        reduce secondary impacts of increased agriculture and development on biodiversity 

        have been entirely left out of the DEIR, we feel the current planning 

        process has not yet fully investigated all possible solutions to the current 

        zoning crisis. Furthermore, adopting the current plan or any of the alternatives 

        will have negative effects on biodiversity in San Diego County and will 

        not lessen the pace or intensity of the county's current biological crisis. 

        However, of the alternative presented, alternative #3, with its creation 

        of 80-acre parcels, will be the best zoning plan for biodiversity in (20) 

        lands. </p>
