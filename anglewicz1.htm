    <TD> <p>Rural Sprawl Hurts All San Diegans<br>

      by Thomas Anglewicz, AIA </p>

      <p>French Premier Clemenceau once stated, "War is too important to be left 

        to the generals." The same appears to be true about land use policy in 

        San Diego County-it is too important to be left to the County Supervisors. 

      </p>

      <p>For over a decade, the County Supervisors have been dedicated to adopting 

        zoning laws that will not only ruin the Backcountry, but also harm all 

        San Diegans. The County's actions run counter to BOTH public opinion and 

        state law. Only numerous interventions by the courts have, so far, prevented 

        the County from creating a future of even worse sprawl, and its consequences, 

        than we already have. </p>

      <p>In 1993, the County proposed to open to development 90,000 acres of inholdings 

        within the Cleveland National Forest. The state courts said, "No." </p>

      <p>In 1995, the County proposed sprawl policies for 190,000 acres of Backcountry 

        land. Again, the courts said, "No." </p>

      <p>And right now, while the County struggles to respond to these past monumental 

        mistakes, it is aggressively pushing forward in its 2020 planning process 

        with even more sweeping proposals that will cause even more harm. Incredibly, 

        the County insists rezoning to prevent sprawl cannot occur unless developers 

        who wish to build in urban areas pay money to "transfer" development rights 

        from rural landowners. Doesn't the County understand that the cost to 

        transfer "development rights" will end up right on top of the already 

        sky-high price of housing? Besides, why, in addition to all the other 

        fees developers already have to pay, should a builder have to pay a dime 

        to build in an area suitable for development? </p>

      <p>The County's "TDR" proposal is a capitulation to rural speculators and 

        an abuse of the County's duty to protect everyone in the County. Unless 

        the County drops its TDR idea and uses its zoning authority on behalf 

        of all the people in the County, its land-use decisions will increase 

        traffic congestion, degrade drinking water, and reinforce the trend of 

        high-cost housing throughout San Diego County. </p>

      <ul>

        <li> <strong>Traffic Congestion</strong>. San Diego Association of Governments' 

          (SANDAG) analyses show that, compared to non-sprawl policies, opening 

          the Backcountry to sprawl will increase traffic congestion by another 

          7% throughout the County, and by MORE than 7% in our already highly 

          congested hot spots.</li>

        <li><strong>Drinking Water</strong>. San Diegans get their purest, best-tasting, 

          least-expensive drinking water from 24 San Diego County reservoirs. 

          These reservoirs, with their 569,000 acre feet of storage capacity, 

          are fed by streams that arise high in the Backcountry and flow mile 

          after mile through the Backcountry to each reservoir. County Supervisors 

          are ignoring the warnings of professional reservoir managers that sprawl 

          will degrade the water quality of the runoff going into these important 

          water resources.</li>

        <li><strong>Housing Costs</strong>. $293,000! That's the median cost of 

          a home now in San Diego County. Only 28% of all households in the region 

          can afford such a home. Housing costs are significantly impacted by 

          sprawl zoning. The strategy for decades has been to build housing on 

          land that is less expensive because it is further from the city centers. 

          That strategy has failed. In San Diego County, sprawl zoning policies 

          have created a huge shortage of building sites. With the County's population 

          growing from 2.8 to 3.8 million by the year 2020, the County needs sites 

          for 360,000 new homes. Sprawl zoning policies, however, leave room for 

          only 260,000 sites--a 100,000-home shortfall. The simple law of supply 

          and demand has not been altered. Sprawl zoning is choking off supply. 

          The vast majority of San Diegans need zoning that allows developers 

          to build houses of a size and type that people can afford. Cutting up 

          the Backcountry is not the answer to San Diego's affordable housing 

          problem! Few people can afford to build a house on the 2, 5 or 10-acre 

          parcels that sprawl zoning creates. </li>

      </ul>

      <p>The people of San Diego County already know that we can't continue just 

        doing the same old thing. In May 2000, the Public Policy Institute of 

        California surveyed 2000 San Diego likely voters about growth. San Diegans 

        were concerned about the impact of one million more people. However, they 

        believe bold new action can handle the huge challenges we face. The survey 

        found that 67% of likely voters favor an urban growth boundary, 79% favor 

        zoning that promotes housing near transit stations and jobs, and a whopping 

        87% believe corruption in government is a major problem. </p>

      <p>Our County Supervisors have wasted millions of dollars trying to paper 

        over their misdirected planning and zoning policies. The courts now have 

        so little faith in San Diego County government that a state judge turned 

        over authority for Backcountry land use decision-making to a local conservation 

        group (Save Our Forests and Ranchlands). This nationally unprecedented 

        situation has been going on for nine years, and is shocking proof that 

        County citizens can't trust County officials to protect the public interest. 

      </p>

      <p>If, indeed, the County can break with its past and move strongly in a 

        new direction, fine. Perhaps our long land-use nightmare may finally be 

        over. But, if the County votes for more of the same, and continues to 

        be far out of step with the voters and with community leaders like the 

        Union-Tribune, San Diegans may be forced to take matters into their own 

        capable hands through an initiative. </p></TD>
