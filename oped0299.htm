    <TD> <p align="center"><em>Note: This Opinion piece was published February 

        1999 right after the Board of Supervisors launched their &quot;Smart Growth&quot; 

        program. SOFAR was challenging the Board to prove its intentions, especially 

        as it related to issues at-hand). GPA 96-03 was to be heard by the Board 

        in the next few months, but it was repeatedly post-phoned and finally 

        determined to be heard right after the March elections. This April 5th, 

        the Board will finally be confronted with making tough choices for the 

        future good of the County.</em></p>

        <strong>SMART GROWTH: Change in heart or change in facade?</strong><br>

        Public cynicism with politics at all levels has reached epidemic proportions. 

        We live in an age when political posturing and dissembling have reached 

        a height matched only by the low esteem in which politicians are held 

        by the public. Consider the San Diego Board of Supervisors' remarkable 

        new posture toward Smart Growth ideals. They would have us believe that 

        they now take seriously the topic of urban sprawl - the issue which most 

        threatens the future quality of life in San Diego with its traffic gridlock, 

        inner city decay, and irreversible loss of environmental resources. The 

        Board plans to convene a &quot;Smart Growth Coalition&quot; this March 

        to discuss San Diego's future development. Why now? Considering their 

        record over the past few years, it is legitimate to be skeptical as to 

        the sincerity of the Board's intentions to implement Smart Growth in San 

        Diego County. But one can hope.</p>

      <p><strong>FOR THE RECORD</strong><br>

        During the last 20-plus years, the Boards' record shows nothing that remotely 

        resembles a proactive approach toward Smart Growth principles. The fact 

        is they have always thwarted Smart Growth ideals. Some of the more egregious 

        examples of their previous positions include:<br>

        * FACT: Since 1979, past and present Boards of Supervisors repeatedly 

        failed to adopt an Agricultural element to the General Plan resulting 

        in loss of over 40,000 acres of farmland.<br>

        * FACT: Since 1979, documented planning failures and legal actions cost 

        taxpayers millions of dollars.<br>

        * FACT: The present Board repeatedly has not met a court order to provide 

        greater protection for Agricultural Preserve lands (SOFAR vs. the County 

        of San Diego).<br>

        * FACT: The present Board vehemently objected to a well planned, scientifically 

        documented and endorsed land-use plan, the Rural Heritage and Watershed 

        Initiative (Proposition B), on the last election ballot.<br>

        * FACT: The present Board ignored SANDAG's &quot;Preliminary 2020 Cities/County 

        Forecast&quot; which documents the harmful effects of the present County 

        course of urban sprawl.</p>

      <p>The facts speak for themselves. This shameful yet very real history invites 

        skepticism about the Board's alleged newfound &quot;calling&quot; to preserve 

        the quality of life in San Diego. SOFAR, the only environmental group 

        to tackle the issue of sprawl up to now, is curiously missing from the 

        list of participants of the so-called &quot;Coalition&quot;. Regardless, 

        if the Board is seriously motivated to make the County aligned with Smart 

        Growth principles, they shouldn't wait for direction from their Coalition 

        as the bulldozers continue to roll. They must act now to prevent urban 

        sprawl and the loss of more open space.</p>

      <p><strong>THREE SIMPLE WAYS</strong><br>

        The Board has the power to decide how our land is used--what developments 

        are appropriate, how transportation and public infrastructures are to 

        be planned and paid for, and how to administer the natural resources in 

        the County. How can we know if the Board is truly serious in their &quot;new 

        commitment&quot;? There are three basic but important ways the County 

        can demonstrate that its intentions are genuine:<br>

        <strong>1. Moratorium.</strong> The most immediate way the Board can demonstrate 

        its seriousness in confronting sprawl is by imposing a building moratorium 

        at the boundaries of existing urban areas until the region has a firm 

        grip on future growth development patterns, infrastructure and financing. 

        One of the key components to Smart Growth is the reinvestment in existing 

        urban areas.<br>

        <strong>2. AG - 20 Lawsuit.</strong> The court has put the County under 

        strict orders to come up with an adequate plan for Agricultural Preserves 

        after the environmental watchdog group Save Our Forests and Ranchlands 

        (SOFAR) sued the County for inappropriate zoning in rural lands. The County 

        will soon issue an EIR for their proposed alternative plans for these 

        dedicated farmlands. This court-ordered response will be the first test 

        of the so-called &quot;smart growth&quot; intentions of the Board.<br>

        <strong>3. Smart Growth Coalition.</strong> The challenge to the Board 

        is to establish a &quot;Smart Growth Coalition&quot; that truly meets 

        the crisis caused by sprawl development. The coalition should be comprised 

        of leaders dedicated to the common interest of the San Diego region. The 

        group should not be weighted with development interests that profit from 

        sprawl and who for years have misled us by telling us we have a &quot;housing 

        crisis&quot;. The reality is that all along we've had a leadership crisis.</p>

      <p>Of the three ways that the Board can demonstrate its good faith to turn 

        the tide against urban sprawl, their decision regarding the AG 20 lawsuit 

        is critical. The Board is required by court order to properly zone almost 

        200,000 areas of backcountry rural lands. These Agricultural Preserve 

        lands have been designated to allow for easy adoption of Williamson contracts, 

        a state ordinance that gives property owners tax relief in the exchange 

        keeping their land from being developed. The urban-style zoning that was 

        illegally allowed on these farmlands ought to be replaced with parcel 

        sizes consistent with viable agriculture. The choice is stark and clear 

        - either the Board chooses parcel sizes consistent with rural resource 

        protection, or they choose the path that leads to subdividing our rural 

        lands and to lining the pockets of special interests.</p>

      <p>The Board of Supervisors serves under the emblem &quot;The noblest motive 

        is the public good.&quot; Duty to the public good reminds us of a earlier 

        era, when the Athenian office holder took an oath &quot;to leave the city 

        more beautiful that he then he found it.&quot; Urban sprawl, for which 

        our public officials are directly responsible, leaves our community poorer 

        in spirit, finances, and precious land resources. Now, more than ever, 

        the Board must be held accountable to their oath of office.</p>
