    <TD> <p>On Wednesday April 5th, the County Board of Supervisors unanimously 

        approved the General Plan Amendment 96-03 (GPA 96-03) that regulates land 

        use on approximately 200,000 acres of wildlands in north and east San 

        Diego County. </p>

      <p align="center"><em>SOFAR is firm in its position that small lot sizes 

        encourages sprawl development and NOT farming as claimed by County staff 

        and the local Farm Bureau (Building Industry front-men). </em></p>

      <p>In addition, we believe that GPA 96-03 is an illegal plan that is based 

        on a flawed Environmental Impact Report (EIR) and on a calculated attempt 

        by County officials to deliberately mislead Federal and State agencies 

        and the public. </p>

      <p>First of all, the EIR amazingly concluded that for the county-wide unmitigable 

        impacts found in virtually every CEQA category there were no feasible 

        mitigation measures possible and, equally amazingly, that <u>no further environmental 

        review would be required</u> for agriculturally clearing at the parcel level. 

        Thus, the Board had to sign overriding considerations for each unmitigable 

        impact category. But the County failed to investigate, <u>as required by 

        law</u>, alternatives that would mitigate of their proposed project. No consideration 

        was given to an alternative that would preserve existing uses. At the 

        hearing, SOFAR introduced a<a href="rangelandStudy.htm"> study by rangeland</a> 

        experts which demonstrates that the San Diego backcountry in its current 

        use is supported by viable, productive rangelands. SOFAR argued that the 

        County should continue the hearing to consider the rangeland alternative 

        that was not considered in the EIR that would obviously mitigate the impacts 

        of the radical change in use proposed by the County's project. The County's 

        own agricultural expert who opined that cattle grazing was no longer viable 

        in the backcountry admitted at the Board hearing that he was not qualified 

        to address rangeland issues. </p>

      <p>Of equal concern to SOFAR is the deliberate misrepresentation of the 

        issue of densification. In late March, the Environmental Protection Agency, 

        after having reviewed the EIR for GPA 96-03, <a href="epa1.htm">wrote 

        a letter to the County</a> expressing concern over the impacts of the 

        project to water quality and to the future water supply to the San Diego 

        region. These detailed statements from a federal agency indicated there 

        was serious trouble with the County's plan. However, the <a href="epa2.htm">EPA 

        revised their letter</a> just prior to the hearing (literally, hours before) 

        after County staff convinced them that GPA 96-03 would not result in an 

        increase but a decrease in density. </p>

      <p>This argument is not based on fact or the law. </p>

      <p>County officials took advantage of abstruse technical terminology in 

        their communications with the EPA, <em>knowing full well</em> that to 

        compare the current proposal with what the Courts ruled to be totally 

        illegal (8-acre zoning), was what CEQA calls a &quot;Plan to Plan Comparison&quot; 

        which is expressly PROHIBITED BY LAW in evaluating the impacts of a proposed 

        project. The Board took advantage of the EPA's retraction and all but 

        dismissed any discussion on the relevance of water quality impacts. </p>

      <p>The matter is not over. The County's proposal and the Board's decision 

        must be deemed sufficient by the Court. </p>

      <p>SOFAR and its attorneys are reviewing carefully the record in order to 

        defend the public good in a matter so consequential to the quality of 

        life for generations to come.<br>
