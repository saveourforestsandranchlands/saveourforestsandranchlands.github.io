      <p>Elves Believe the Fix Is In--Are They Wrong?<br>

        Environment: The frail reed of the law can hardly stop the rape of the 

        San Diego back country by commercial developers.</p>

      <p><br>

        By ALEXANDER COCKBURN </p>

      <p>What drives members of groups like Earth Liberation Front (ELF) to court 

        lifetime prison sentences by incinerating a ski complex in Vail or Boise 

        Cascade offices in Oregon? It's simple. The &quot;Elves&quot; and many 

        young people who sympathize with them have come to the conclusion that 

        when nature rapers scorn laws on the books and government sides with the 

        nature rapers, then desperate times demand desperate measures. </p>

      <p>The Clinton years have seen a terrible hollowing out of the Endangered 

        Species Act (that Vail development invaded protected lynx habitat) and 

        one destructive, so-called &quot;win-win&quot; compromise--sell-out--after 

        another brokered by Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt. There are thousands 

        of examples. Here's just one. </p>

      <p>Head south from Los Angeles, turn east after Oceanside and head for Ramona 

        or Julian. You'll discover that at the heart of San Diego County are mountains 

        forming a blue wall between the coast and the deep desert. Rising to these 

        peaks and buffering them from the cities are the magnificent rolling grasslands 

        and oak-covered foothills of what San Diegans call the back country, its 

        pastures carrying not only cattle but also live oak, golden eagles and 

        profuse other bird life. The country looks dry but is an important watershed, 

        supplying the coastal cities with as much as 15% of their water. </p>

      <p>The real estate market in California is now so feverish that the big 

        ranches--rezoned out of agricultural designation and onto the open market--are 

        ripe targets for development. Given the power of the developers, this 

        transition should have been easy, were it not for the efforts of a small 

        group of environmentalists. </p>

      <p>Over the past 10 years, Save Our Forest and Ranchlands has been waging 

        a stubborn campaign against the suburbanization of the back country. We're 

        not talking ELF firebrands here. We're talking the League of Women Voters, 

        the astronomers of Mt. Palomar, BayKeeper and assorted herpetologists 

        and botanists. Save Our Forests put together a coalition of environmental 

        and community groups and sued the county for failing to protect the back 

        country. In 1996, Superior Court Judge Judith D. McConnell found San Diego 

        County in violation of several state laws and its own environmental standards 

        and gave tiny Save Our Forest authority over hundreds of thousands of 

        back country acres. </p>

      <p>Finally, earlier this year, the county came up with a plan. It proposed 

        to break up the big rangelands into 10-acre parcels, demurely described 

        as small farms. This pleasing vision of mom 'n' pop truck farms raising 

        mangoes, orchids and macadamia nuts collides with the reality that this 

        part of San Diego County has no ground water suitable for such specialty 

        farming and little other infrastructure. </p>

      <p>The real future under the county plan would be luxury ranchettes linked 

        by new freeways and serviced by off-ramp commerce. In other words, exactly 

        the sort of unsmart growth that everyone from Vice President Al Gore down 

        to the San Diego Assn. of Governments has been complaining about. (San 

        Diego has the highest rate of habitat loss and more endangered plants 

        and animal species than any county in the U.S.) </p>

      <p>Not to be defeated, Save Our Forests and their allies brought the new 

        plan to the attention of the Environmental Protection Agency. On March 

        31, Nancy Woo, the agency's regional chief, sent a letter to the county 

        supervisors and to Mayor Susan Golding, advising them that the plan threatened 

        the quality and quantity of the region's water and would gravely impact 

        air, endangered wildlife and open space. </p>

      <p>Woo's letter threw the county officials into desperation. It looked as 

        though the scheming of years had gone for naught. Then, just before the 

        crucial April 5 meeting, Woo rushed another letter to the San Diego officials. 

        She said she had misinterpreted the plan and that her first letter should 

        be disregarded. </p>

      <p>In fact, Woo had not misinterpreted any significant part of the plan. 

        But in her second letter she did not advise the board to withhold approval 

        pending further study. The supervisors were off the hook and, on April 

        5, passed the amendment that could mean that San Diego's back country 

        will disappear into condoland interspersed with Indian casinos. </p>

      <p>The game is not quite over yet. Because the county is still under court 

        supervision, the plan can't go ahead until McConnell signs off on it. 

      </p>

      <p>So here we have an environmental disaster in the making, one that is 

        an obvious test case for any supposed commitment by government to bar 

        insane squandering of natural resources. We have county government acting 

        as the creature of the big developers. We have a weak regulatory agency 

        with the nature rapers held in check only by the frail reed of the law 

        of the land and a crusading group like Save Our Forests. </p>

      <p>This is but one episode in a dire national story. I don't want to be 

        construed as offering endorsement or encouragement, but it's not entirely 

        surprising that elves figure the fix is in, will always be in and reckon 

        that if the lawmakers are lawless, they might as well take the same path.
