        <strong>The Killing of Carmel Mountain</strong></p>

      <p>Originally published in CounterPunch.</p>

      <p>by Susan Davis</p>

      <p>Professor of Communications at UC San Diego</p>

      <p>Cooked up in 1991 by George Bush and Pete Wilson of California, then 

        seized on by Al Gore and Bruce Babbitt, a crafty ploy called the Multi-Species 

        Conservation Plan has become the weapon of choice of real estate developers 

        to nullify the Endangered Species Act and destroy the choicest remnants 

        of natural habitat that still survive in America today. It will be coming 

        soon to an ecosystem near you. Here's what happened in its first big test 

        run in San Diego County.*</p>

      <p>Every day hundreds of hikers and joggers sweat their way uphill to the 

        red cliff tops at San Diego's Torrey Pines State Park, whence a view of 

        the Pacific ocean, maybe a glimpse of a migrating grey whale, the scent 

        of black sage. Keep your eyes on the western horizon and try not to glance 

        back to the view eastward over Los Penasquitos estuary and Interstate 

        Five.</p>

      <p>At the intersection of the San Diego Freeway and Routes 805 and 56 the 

        California Department of Transportation is building one of the largest 

        interchanges in Southern California, presumptively in the entire world: 

        a convulsion of concrete and asphalt that in just a few years will knit 

        together twenty north-south lanes. Rising above this &quot;merge&quot; 

        is Carmel Mountain (so named for the convent founded by Irish nuns back 

        in the 1890s), a series of tilted mesas once covered with some of Southern 

        California's last remaining coastal sage scrub and maritime chaparral. 

        Under the freeways is the upper end of the delicate Penasquitos estuary, 

        one of California's last unpaved wetlands.</p>

      <p>In any silhouette familiar to all the previous inhabitants of the region, 

        Carmel Mountain has ceased to exist. The mesa has been scraped and graded, 

        its canyons filled in and paved, its cliffs and ridges re-contoured into 

        strangely symmetrical waves. Millions of tons of its soft, sandy shoulders 

        are being sliced off and hauled away. The landform looks like a giant 

        green cake that's been attacked with a serrated knife. On its newly shaved 

        surfaces, shallow steps are cut to keep soil from washing or blowing away. 

        The steps are then sprayed with green dye and ground cover seeds. The 

        result is a low, sandy pyramid that stretches for several sad miles. The 

        pyramid's sides have been planted with stucco cubes holding insurance, 

        HMO, and real estate offices. Its flat top is spread thick with ocean 

        view estates, many priced &#8220;from the low $1,000,000s&quot;.</p>

      <p>I don't know if most commuters traveling I-5 remember what Carmel Mountain 

        looked like even a few years ago. When traffic is moving, I imagine most 

        hunch away from the side window and try to not to look. In daily conversation, 

        no one mentions what's happening to Carmel Mountain. The awful scene creates 

        a kind of numbness. On the other hand, when you're stuck in the traffic 

        at the merge, it's hard to miss the fleets of bulldozers above you, hectically 

        reworking Carmel's slopes. As I watch them, though the memories are becoming 

        harder to retrieve, I can recall the mesa's massive flanks, green with 

        wild mustard in springtime, a dangerous crisp gold in fall.</p>

      <p>San Diego's coastal mesas used to be ocean bottom -- soft, compressed 

        sand and mud that pushed upward less than a million years ago. Small rivers 

        and creeks draining from the east eroded wide valleys like Penasquitos, 

        Sorrento and Carmel, and cut hundreds of tiny, steep finger canyons. Soft 

        chaparral evolved to cover the hills and canyons. The coast gets less 

        than ten inches of rain a year, but with fog and ocean mist there's enough 

        moisture to support a fragrant scrub of sages, mints, lemonade berry, 

        cactus and brittlebrush. Hundreds of varieties of plants and wildflowers 

        make a unique mosaic; some species, like Dudleyia brevifolia and Del Mar 

        manzanita, are found nowhere else. Fragile networks of vernal pools sustain 

        amphibians and the San Diego fairy shrimp, a rare invertebrate.</p>

      <p>Native Americans fished and gathered; the Spanish and Mexicans, and later 

        Anglos ran cattle in the valleys. In this century, they also dry-farmed 

        beans and irrigated for tomatoes and strawberries. By the 1960s Carmel 

        Valley was one of the last undeveloped valleys running to the coast. Carmel 

        and Sorrento Creeks still flooded twice daily with the tides, and the 

        hills held affordable rural digs for a few hundred college professors, 

        students, artists and retirees. In the side canyons, semi-hidden ranchos 

        housed Mexican migrant workers. Although humans impinged, estuary, valley 

        and mesa were still connected in a rich, working ecosystem, in part because 

        San Diego held much of the area around Carmel Mountain in an urban reserve 

        of agricultural and wild lands. Up and down the valleys, from the river 

        mouth to the foothills of the mountains, deer, cougar and bobcat freely 

        roamed.</p>

      <p>As I-5 was completed in the sixties, the big developers understood that 

        freeway access had turned the scrubby-looking coastal mesas into prime 

        real estate. Pardee Construction Company, a subsidiary of Weyerhaeuser, 

        bought up large patches of land and persuaded elected officials that the 

        urban reserve needed to be planned to save it from....developers. A thirty 

        years' war ensued between the developers, with the city and its planners 

        in their pocket, and community activists and ecologists mustered in an 

        uneven coalition that fought, year after year, the area's destruction.</p>

      <p>One of these long-haul warriors is Isabelle Kay, an ecologist who manages 

        land reserves for the University of California. She's fought for Carmel 

        Mountain for years. &quot;It's an absolutely unique land form', she says. 

        Even though most of it fell outside the protected area, &quot;it was designated 

        by the city as a core area of the highest quality habitat and very important 

        to save. From the 1960s on, it was always marked red on every map.&quot; 

        But by the mid-1970s, the San Diego Planning Commission was issuing orders 

        limiting development in the urban reserve one day, and granting loopholes 

        and exceptions the next. Under public pressure to conform to their own 

        past plans, city council members repeatedly decried the &quot;lack of 

        planning&quot;. The calls for more planning led in turn to zoning shifts 

        and more sketches for &quot;managing&quot; the growth of the new tract 

        neighborhoods Pardee had begun to build. Carmel Mountain was becoming 

        an island.</p>

      <p>In retrospect, Isabelle Kay sees the planning process itself was an enormous 

        part of the problem. &quot;It was a shell game.&quot; Once developer-guided 

        planning was underway in the urban reserve, speculative pressure fell 

        upon on Carmel Mountain. Here too Pardee had bought several hundred acres 

        and was pressuring the city to allow construction. The city produced an 

        environmental impact report which argued that development of the mesa, 

        now renamed &quot;Neighborhood 8-A&quot;, would have devastating environmental 

        effects. But then, at the developer's behest, the planners broke the mesa 

        into five smaller neighborhoods; each of these developments was put through 

        the city's approval process separately, absorbing enormous amounts of 

        local activist energy. And although the neighborhood plans were said to 

        be just &quot;plans&quot; -- not facts about the future -- land values 

        shot up as each was approved, raising the developers' stake in each project. 

        When Kay and the Carmel Mountain Conservancy objected that building subdivisions 

        would have terrible effects on plants, animals and the watershed as a 

        whole, they were told &quot;8A has had an EIR.&quot; Never mind that the 

        piecemeal plans flouted it.</p>

      <p>If planning simply greased the wheels of development, could anything 

        else have saved the mesa? The federal Endangered Species Act did slow 

        things down, since the mesa was home to the California gnatcatcher, and 

        the fairy shrimp, both listed. But Carmel's real biological uniqueness 

        was the patterns of its vegetation, and the Endangered Species Act does 

        not protect plants on private lands. The Carmel Mountain Conservancy and 

        its allies fought the subdivisions, one by one, while urging the city 

        to buy the mesa outright.</p>

      <p>Then Pete Wilson brought Natural Communities Conservation Planning to 

        San Diego. Influenced by Pardee's vice-president Mike Madigan, and ever 

        sensitive to the needs of big real estate, in 1991 the governor claimed 

        that the Endangered Species Act and the gnatcatcher were causing an &quot;environmental 

        train wreck&quot; that had to be stopped. Under Wilson's scheme, enforcement 

        of the ESA would be suspended while a coalition of governments, planning 

        authorities, developers, and state and federal agencies, including the 

        Fish and Wildlife Service and the State Department of Fish and Game, set 

        up systems of linked preserves to provide permanent habitat for threatened 

        birds, plants and animals. Not coincidentally and at the same time the 

        Bush administration slashed Fish and Wildife's staff and declared a moratorium 

        on species listings.</p>

      <p>With astonishingly diverse terrain and more than eighty threatened and 

        endangered plants and animals, San Diego County was one of the first big 

        test cases of Wilson's, Babbitt's and Bush's magical plan. Its Multiple 

        Species Conservation Plan is a patchwork of 172,000 acres spread over 

        900 square miles. The &quot;Plan&quot; directs regulatory focus to whole 

        habitats, and so Carmel Mountain had everyone's close attention: Southern 

        California's coastal sage scrub was nearly gone, and by the mid-1990s, 

        San Diego had lost 97% of its vernal pools. Southern maritime chaparral 

        had been reduced to 2,400 acres in the United States, and four hundred 

        of these were on Carmel Mountain.</p>

      <p>An important operating principle of Wilson-Babbitry is that local governments 

        rather than the feds should take the lead in interpreting environmental 

        regulations. Of course, local officials are likely to be very close to 

        local real estate interests. In San Diego they are nearly one and the 

        same. Wilson-Babbitry urges &quot;flexible&quot; (winsome word!) interpretation 

        of the rules to create &quot;win-win&quot; solutions. Flexibility means 

        that developers get to cut environmental deals, swapping or selling left-over 

        and undesirable land into the habitat preserve against the right to develop 

        on or next to sensitive land. These scraps need have no value as habitat 

        and in San Diego &quot;essential corridors&quot; between bits of habitat 

        can turn out to be asphalt highways or concrete culverts. The City of 

        San Diego completely inadequate mechanisms for monitoring protections, 

        preserve areas and mitigations.</p>

      <p>And most important, the MSCP installs special protections for the land 

        speculators: after a development has been approved under the plan, no 

        further environmental limits can be imposed for fifty years (in the Riverside 

        and Orange County versions of the plan, it is seventy years). This &quot;no 

        surprises&quot; clause means that no matter what happens to a species, 

        a watershed, or in the world of science, nothing will interfere with the 

        owner's ability to profit from that piece of land.</p>

      <p>Carmel Mountain was one of the first casualties of the Multiple Species 

        Conservation Plan. The activists were optimistic at first. Alison Rolfe 

        of the Southwest Center for Biodiversity says &quot;We were really hopeful 

        that the MSCP would help us save Carmel Mountain, and we tried to work 

        with it.&quot; &quot;All the talk of holistic planning made people think 

        it was going to be done right,&quot; Isabelle Kay laments. The mesa glowed 

        bright red on Fish and Wildlife's maps. But Kay and her allies quickly 

        found out what flexibility really meant. Frustrated by the locals' insistence 

        that the mesa was an irreplaceable resource, Pardee huddled with City 

        Manager Jack McGrory, a noted pro-development fixer, to talk about the 

        fate of what by now were fabulously valuable holdings. Together, behind 

        closed doors, they simply redrew the dimensions of the core habitat area 

        on the mountain's map.</p>

      <p>Although this creative cartography was rejected by every scientist and 

        environmental group as scientifically unsound, Fish and Wildlife approved 

        it. Although city council timidly disavowed the new line, somehow it always 

        appeared on subsequent maps. In the bait and switch that followed, the 

        developers simply began moving the boundaries on parcels as needed, transferring 

        sensitive packages out from under scrutiny, trading small wildlife reserves 

        for the space to build golf courses and artificial lakes. In the endgame, 

        Pardee proposed that it would cede 150 acres of the most contested acres 

        to a habitat preserve if the city would guarantee it unrestricted development 

        of another package in the urban reserve. Since this release of public 

        land had to be approved by voters, Pardee demanded that the Sierra Club 

        publicly endorse the swap. The Sierra Club graciously complied.</p>

      <p>Fourteen local organizations, led by Alison Rolfe, are suing Fish and 

        Wildlife to halt the Multiple Species Conservation Plan in San Diego, 

        Riverside and Orange Counties, arguing that it destroys wetlands and creates 

        the fragmentation it claims to prevent. Isabelle Kay figures that even 

        the old agricultural zoning, with the ESA, would have protected much more 

        of Carmel Mountain and its environs. The MSCP, she says, &quot;treats 

        subdivisions like living organisms and living organisms as if they are 

        inert&quot;.</p>

      <p>It's over for Carmel Mountain, Del Mar Mesa and Penasquitos Lagoon as 

        an ecosystem. Canyons through which seasonal streams ran are blocked with 

        concrete. Wildlife corridors where Isabelle Kay once photographed thousands 

        of animal tracks in mud have been sealed off by the I-5 expansion. Though 

        still beautiful to look at, the estuary is a heavily silted catchment 

        for suburban storm sewers. Its exit into the ocean at Torrey Pines beach 

        is too polluted for swimming: under new Coastal Commission rules, it is 

        daily posted as unsafe. Even the valley's sense of open space has been 

        lost. Residents who could once walk to the lagoon are now cut off by six 

        lanes of surface traffic. &quot;Public hiking trails&quot; border the 

        freeways and cut through parking lots.</p>

      <p>Even though the MSCP was a George Bush-Pete Wilson production, it will 

        no doubt be used this year to help position Al Gore as a forward-looking 

        green. The &quot;success&quot; of the Multiple Species Conservation Plan 

        in San Diego County is being touted by the Nature Conservancy, and various 

        &quot;flexible&quot; green activists. Don't doubt that this same process 

        is coming soon to an ecosystem near you, especially if your region has 

        a hot economy and a lot of open space left. But take a drive down I-5 

        and get a look at what's left of Carmel Mountain. It's what a win-win 

        solution really looks like.</p>
