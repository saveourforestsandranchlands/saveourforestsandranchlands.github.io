        <blockquote>This is a special time for all of us here at SOFAR, as 2002 marks the 

        10-year anniversary of our organization! Thanks to all of our loyal supporters, 

        we are very proud to report a decade of many important land-use victories 

        for San Diego residents. We expect our development-crazed County to have 

        much work for us in the year to come. Of course, with your continued help 

        we will continue our monitoring of GPA 96-03, GP 2020 and a flood of individual 

        backcountry projects, and continue to follow efforts to reform regional 

        planning and governance. </blockquote>

        <blockquote>SOFAR would like to announce that we are beginning 2002 with a bang! We 

        received a $10,000 donation from an anonymous supporter. As you know, 

        SOFAR relies on its members&#8217; contributions to help sustain our efforts; 

        things like hiring consultants to prepare professional comments on significant 

        projects, legal representation in efforts like General Plan Amendment 

        96-03, and keeping up our public outreach efforts through our website 

        (www.sofar.org) and mailings. Thanks again to this significant benefactor 

        and all our supporters! </blockquote>

        <blockquote>Duncan will be on a panel at LEAD's 2002 Economic/Smart Growth Seminar

      <p><font size="2"><strong><u>SOFAR Needs An Intern!</u> 

        </strong></font></p>

        <blockquote>Help contribute to the most successful activist group in San Diego&#8212;SOFAR 

        needs help maintaining its project database. This is an on-going assignment 

        that helps us to continue our role as watchdog of San Diego&#8217;s backcountry. 

        We need an intern who is available every week to coordinate with Duncan 

        on significant projects so we can keep our supporters and other interested 

        persons up-to-date with the deluge of development happening in our area. 

        Outside of the government planning departments, SOFAR is the only group 

        maintaining such a list of significant projects online. This is an especially 

        good opportunity for planning students or others interested in learning 

        more about local planning. Call Duncan at 619-230-1963 if you are interested 

        in helping us in this task. </blockquote>
