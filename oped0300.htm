      <p><strong>County's New Plan will make matters much worse.<br>

        By Duncan McFetridge</strong></p>

      <p>Beneath the gloss of good times, there's a growing sense of crisis in 

        San Diego County. Daily experience validates it: Freeways are growing 

        more crowded and the open spaces we value are being destroyed by leap-frogging 

        subdivisions. If San Diego does not check its pattern of far-flung suburban 

        development, our quality of rural and urban life will continue to slide 

        downhill with expensive and irreversible results. And there's a sense 

        of frustration. City and county residents fear that our elected officials, 

        having failed to address these problems for years, are doing little to 

        solve them now.</p>

      <p>The most recent case of what we will politely call planning failure comes 

        before the Board of Supervisors on April 5, in the form of GPA 96-03, 

        an amendment to county's General Plan. It sounds like another boring slab 

        of bureaucracy, but it could have far reaching effects on water quality, 

        traffic, air, beaches and public services throughout the county.</p>

      <p>Back in 1996 the Superior Court, responding to a lawsuit brought by Save 

        Our Forests and Ranchlands (SOFAR), declared the county's General Plan 

        illegal. The General Plan is supposed to regulate land use in the public 

        interest, not just by preventing sprawl; it must also preserve critical 

        natural and economic resources. Because it lacked mandatory preservation 

        policies and placed development zoning on our wild and agricultural lands, 

        the Plan violated several important state laws. The county was ordered 

        to come back in six months with a legally sound preservation plan. Now, 

        after four years of fiddling while Rome burns, they are back with this 

        proposed change.</p>

      <p>A look at the amendment shows that while it purports to &quot;facilitate 

        agriculture,&quot; in reality it gives developers -- and those developers 

        in overalls, the Farm Bureau --license to strip our back country clean.</p>

      <p>The county's proposal offers none of the protections they were ordered 

        to come up with. In the name of agriculture, the proposal would actually 

        allow the clearing, grading and subdivision of 200,000 acres, an area 

        twice the size of Camp Pendleton, into ranchettes. This is &quot;smart 

        growth&quot; ? Even worse, the county's own Environmental Impact Report 

        admits that the plan will have county-wide, unmitigable impacts to traffic, 

        air, water, biology, geology, archaeology and scenery. Just to be clear, 

        &quot;unmitigable&quot; doesn't mean &quot;unfortunate&quot;: it means 

        devastating and irreversible.</p>

      <p>A valid land use plan should help conserve, not waste, water for the 

        entire county. It should encourage sustainable agriculture and discourage 

        high-irrigation, chemically-managed farming which is completely inappropriate 

        to our back country. It should preserve rich grazing and open ranch lands, 

        and forests that present and future generations will need. It should buffer 

        our precious national forests from condo complexes and freeway off-ramps.</p>

      <p>Because the proposal fails to distinguish between appropriate and inappropriate 

        agricultural uses for the back country, and because it has no enforcement 

        mechanisms, it is grossly inadequate.</p>

      <p>SOFAR has an alternative. We propose large lot zoning, with mandatory 

        environmental review and enforcement for any clearing and subdivision 

        of land. Our alternative is supported by the Audubon Society, the Sierra 

        Club, the California Native Plant Society; local civil groups including 

        the Vulcan Mountain Association, the Ramona Crest and Boulevard Sponsor 

        groups, and eminent biologists, including UCSD's Ted Case, SDSU's Ellen 

        Bauder and Michael Soule of the national Wildlands Project.</p>

      <p>It's a travesty to label lands &quot;resource conservation areas&quot; 

        and &quot;highest environmental value,&quot; and then fail to protect 

        them. It's a scandal that once again the same politicians who have resisted 

        taking real measures to protect our county's quality of life are offering 

        such a deeply flawed plan. At a time when public concern over land use 

        is boiling over, our elected leaders talk about &quot;smart growth&#8221; 

        while cooking up another scheme to ease the way for inappropriate development. 

        We have almost no time left to do things right: as the recent week-long 

        sewage leak showed, San Diego County's infrastructure is decades behind 

        it's pattern of rapid suburban growth. Adequate public transportation 

        is still a daydream, and many of our urban areas are staggering under 

        long years of disinvestment and neglect.</p>

      <p>Recent history shows that sprawl and the destruction of the back country 

        have not been slowed by the Board of Supervisors and their planning department. 

        Far from it. Only grassroots activism, including ballot initiatives and 

        citizen-led lawsuits, has been effective. Once again, it's up to the public 

        to protect San Diego county from phony planning.</p>

      <p>We must insist that the Board of Supervisors reject GPA 96-03.</p>
