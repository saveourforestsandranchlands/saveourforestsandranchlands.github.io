        County</u></strong></font>

      <blockquote>WE WON! San Diego activists won a decisive victory 

        for open government in the Rural Heritage &amp; Watershed Initiative Committee 

        lawsuit against the County of San Diego Board of Supervisors for withholding 

        documents regarding RHWI.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>The lawsuit, filed under the Public Records Act, asked 

        the Superior Court to order the Board of Supervisors to reveal a number 

        of documents providing evidence of the County's electioneering effort 

        to thwart RHWI, or Prop B, an important citizen's initiative to stop 

        urban sprawl. RHWI lawyers had sought these documents to show bias on 

        the part of high-ranking public officials regarding Prop B. This represents 

        the beginning of the unveiling of the special interests that have long 

        controlled the County government. </blockquote>

      <blockquote>&quot;The public has a right to know if the Board 

        of Supervisors, controlled by special interests, used their office to 

        fight against one of the most important growth management initiatives 

        in the history of San Diego County&quot;, states Duncan McFetridge, Chairman 

        of the RHWI Committee.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>The last group of documents was ordered to be turned 

        over to the RHWI Committee by Judge Pate of the Superior Court during 

        a brief trial on October 25, 1999. These four documents include communications 

        to Board members from their aides as well as handwritten notes by Supervisor 

        Horn regarding RWHI. The judge will rule on Thursday, October 28, 1999 

        whether or not the handwritten notes by Supervisor Horn also should be 

        disclosed. </blockquote></TD>
