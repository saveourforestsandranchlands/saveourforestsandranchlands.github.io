  	<TD> <P>The following is an update on various projects being 

        processed by the County:</P>

      <p><u><font size=2><strong>GPA 96-03</strong></font></u></p>

      <blockquote>Portions of the EIR for GPA 96-03 will have to be 

        recirculated due to additional information added to the document. The 

        portions to be recirculated are traffic and noise. The document is due 

        to go out to the public for comment on September 23, 1999. This important 

        issue is tentatively planned to be heard before the Planning Commission 

        on January 21, 2000.</blockquote>

      <p><u><font size=2><strong>RAMONA RIDGE ESTATES</strong></font></u></p>

      <blockquote>Ramona Ridge Estates is a proposed project involving 

        215 acres and 18 lots. This subdivision takes place on Ag 20 - Agricultural 

        Preserve - farmlands. The project site is at the northeast corner 

        of Santa Teresa Valley, east of Ramona, and contains much of Whale Mountain. 

        The topography is rolling oak-dotted grasslands that have been used for 

        grazing. Whale Mountain contains a Golden Eagle nest site. The County 

        claims that the project's application was complete before the judge's 

        ruling of the moratorium on Ag 20 lands. SOFAR is going to challenge the 

        County's vested rights doctrine. Public comments are due on the proposed 

        Mitigated Negative Declaration on September 7, 1999.</blockquote>

      <p><u><font size=2><strong>OAKS AT DESCANSO</strong></font></u></p>

      <blockquote>The host species for the Quino Checkerspot Butterfly 

        has been found on the site of the Oaks at Descanso project. It has yet 

        to be determined what additional biological studies will be needed. This 

        proposed project would put 85 RV spaces, a caretaker's residence, 

        a SFD residence, commercial store, meeting hall, a maintenance and storage 

        facility, restroom, laundry facilities, tennis court, and exercise yard 

        on a 62-acre oak-lined meadow, part of a deer corridor, at the entrance 

        to the Cleveland National Forest in Descanso. The applicant has asked 

        that the County not continue processing the project until the additional 

        biological studies can be made.</blockquote>

      <p><u><font size=2><strong>MAGGIO RANCH</strong></font></u></p>

      <blockquote>Maggio Ranch is a proposed project of 39 dwelling 

        units on a 105-acre horse ranch in Descanso. Consultants are still working 

        on response to public comments on the EIR. They had asked for, and were 

        granted, a 30-day extension until August 24, 1999. By the way, the project 

        site is being offered for sale.</blockquote>

      <p><u><font size=2><strong>LIVE OAK RANCH</strong></font></u></p>

      <blockquote>Live Oak Ranch is a 327-acre project with 146 dwelling 

        units in Valley Center. The project has already received a waiver of Policy 

        I-78 - Small Wastewater Treatment Plant - from the Board of 

        Supervisors. The Planning Commission has recommended approval of the Major 

        Use Permit for the project. The issue will go before the Board on September 

        24, 1999.</blockquote>
