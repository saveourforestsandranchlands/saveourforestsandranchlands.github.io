      <blockquote>The Board of Supervisors quietly rescinded GPA 96-03 on September 18 

        as a consent item on the day's agenda. Prior to the meeting, they removed 

        from their resolution language objectionable to SOFAR's attorneys. Our 

        attorneys had objected to a clause in the original resolution that would 

        have reinstated the original illegal zoning. </blockquote>

      <blockquote>We decided, in light of current events that a press conference could 

        be held at a later time. </blockquote>

      <blockquote>Perhaps when an action item comes up on the new EIR for 96-03. As we 

        mentioned in an earlier Watchdog, the County is rushing forward with a 

        new EIR on virtually the same project that failed so miserably to meet 

        factual and legal standards. Perhaps their behavior recalls Aristotle's 

        observation in the Topics where he pointed out that not all problems can 

        be solved by rational persuasion; for example if you don't believe that 

        snow is white you don't need rational persuasion you need a pair of glasses. 

      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>Final comments on the new EIR are due September 24. We have our full 

        professional team working on this latest disaster in the making.</blockquote>

        in San Diego Backcountry </blockquote>

      <blockquote>Board of Supervisors meets to rescind GPA 96-03 today, September 18, 

        2001 </blockquote>

      <blockquote>In dramatic confirmation of a recent finding by the Public Policy Institute 

        of California linking corruption in </blockquote>

      <blockquote>government with a failure to solve regional growth problems, the County 

        of San Diego has called an end to its five-year campaign to illegally 

        rezone 191,000 acres of rural lands in San Diego's backcountry. Attorney's 

        for the County notified representatives for Save Our Forest And Ranchlands 

        (SOFAR) that the San Diego County Board of Supervisors has decided to 

        abandon its legal challenge to a Superior Court order issued last August 

        which found the County's General Plan Amendment (GPA) 96-03 in violation 

        of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). </blockquote>

      <blockquote>The case took on statewide and national attention when it drew the interest 

        of the Attorney General of the State of California and the Environmental 

        Protection Agency (EPA). In commenting on the County's action, the EPA 

        stated that &quot;the anticipated development will impact the quality 

        and quantity of the regions drinking water supply.&quot; The Attorney 

        General took the unusual step of filing an amicus brief in support of 

        SOFAR stating that &quot;The potential clearing and grading of vast amounts 

        of natural habitat in San Diego County without any further environmental 

        review will impair or destroy the state's biological resources, damaging 

        habitats utilized by numerous sensitive plant and animal species.&quot; 

      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>The County's decision to drop the appeal is clear and unprecedented admission 

        of wrongdoing which cost county taxpayers $2 million and creates, in the 

        midst of critical, long-range planning efforts like the County's 2020 

        General Plan Update and a new regional governance plan, a giant credibility 

        gap for the Board of Supervisors and the County Planning Department. Underlining 

        the significance of this case is the fact that the Superior Court in its 

        original ruling in 1996 placed a subdivision moratorium on the affected 

        lands, removing all permitting authority from the County and designating 

        SOFAR as interim land use authority. SOFAR has held this position for 

        five years. </blockquote>

      <blockquote>Joining SOFAR in friends of the court briefs were the California Attorney 

        General's office, San Diego Sierra Club, San Diego Audubon Society, California 

        Native Plant Society, Center for Biological Diversity, Surfrider Foundation, 

        San Diego Bay Keeper, California Oaks Foundation, Environmental Health 

        Coalition, and the Mountain Defense League. </blockquote>
