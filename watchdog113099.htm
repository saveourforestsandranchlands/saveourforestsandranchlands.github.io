      <blockquote>The Public Records Act lawsuit came to a victorious conclusion 
        with County Counsel releasing the final batch of documents to the public 
        regarding the Rural Heritage &amp; Watershed Initiative from the San Diego 
        County Board of Supervisors. The County spent $ 60,000 in a vain attempt 
        to keep these, as well as previously released, documents from public disclosure. 
        This last batch included a record of Dianne Jacob's ill-fated campaign, 
        aimed at RHWI, to keep city voters from voting on County issues.</blockquote>
      <p><font size="2"><strong><u>Appeal of DPLU'S Approval of Alpine Albertson's 
        Liquor License</u></strong></font></p>
      <blockquote>On December 3, 1999, an appeal of the Department of Planning 
        &amp; Land Use's decision to issue a letter of convenience and necessity 
        for the liquor license for the proposed Alpine Albertson's will be heard 
        by the Planning Commission. This appeal has been brought by the Alpine 
        Planning Group. The Group had voted to recommend that the County deny 
        the liquor license arguing approval of this license will have an adverse 
        impact on their community. Over 70 letters have been received by Alcoholic 
        Beverage Control asking them to deny the liquor license.</blockquote>
      <p><font size="2"><strong><u>Ramona Ridge Estates Goes Before the Planning 
        &amp; Environmental Review Board</u></strong></font></p>
      <blockquote>Ramona Ridge Estates, a proposed 220 acre, 18-lot subdivision 
        ocated in Agricultural Preserve farmland, will go before the Planning 
        &amp; Environmental Review Board on December 9, 1999. This proposal not 
        only makes a mockery of Agricultural Preserve zoning by proposing 8-acre 
        minimum lot sizes but would disrupt a nesting pair of Golden Eagles known 
        to inhabit Whale Mountain. The western half of Whale Mountain is located 
        within the proposed subdivision. </blockquote>
      <p><font size="2"><strong><u>Jacumba Valley Ranch Goes Before the Planning 
        Commission</u></strong></font></p>
      <blockquote>Jacumba Valley Ranch is a massive project proposing 1,048 dwelling 
        units, a 200-room hotel, congregate-care facility, and commercial area 
        on 1,250 acres of farmland in the sparsely settled town of Jacumba. Prime 
        farmland occupies hundreds of acres of this proposal. This proposed project 
        goes before the Planning Commission on December 17, 1999. </blockquote>
      <p><font size="2"><strong><u>General Plan Amendment 96-03 - Agricultural 
        Preserve Farmland</u></strong></font></p>
      <blockquote>Comments on the recirculated portions of the Environmental Impact 
        Report for GPA 96-03 are due by 4 pm on December 6, 1999. The recirculated 
        portions are Traffic &amp; Circulation, Noise, and Water Quality. This 
        EIR covers the County's proposal, including minimum lot sizes, for Agricultural 
        Preserve farmland. Experts engaged by SOFAR have found the proposal to 
        be inadequate.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>Duncan McFetridge will be the featured guest on the *North County 
        at Large* show hosted by Ken Layton to be broadcast on December 12th at 
        10 pm on KFSD 92.1 FM. </blockquote>
