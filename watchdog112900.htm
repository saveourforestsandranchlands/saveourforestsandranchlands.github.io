      <blockquote> The County is holding a series of public hearings regarding 

        GP 2020. Two previous Planning Commission hearings were held the 13 and 

        27 November 2000. The next Planning Commission hearing is scheduled for 

        Friday, 1 December 2000. The hearing will be held at the Scottish Rite 

        Center (1815 Camino del Rio South, Mission Valley) at 9 am. It is expected 

        that the Planning Commission will make its formal recommendations at this 

        hearing. The Board of Supervisors has scheduled its hearing for 10 January 

        2001. </blockquote>

      <blockquote>The private property forces have joined in the fray. They have 

        teamed up with development, building industry, and real estate interests 

        and formed a group called Save Our Land Values. The Farm Bureau is recommending 

        its members call them and get involved.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>SOFAR has taken the position that the County’s plan is upside 

        down. First, we should plan for our county’s precious natural resources. 

        Then, we should plan how to best place the people according to Smart Growth 

        principles. SOFAR’ s position is supported by the San Diego and Palomar 

        Audubon Societies, the Mountain Defense League, and Back Country Coalition.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>The Ramona Community Planning Group (RCPG) has twice been successful 

        in fighting the clustered golf course project planned for Cumming Ranch 

        in west-end Ramona. This 685-acre rolling ranchland is part of the Highland 

        Valley area of grasslands that a local Ramona group is actively trying 

        to protect and acquire as a wildlife preserve.</blockquote>

	  <blockquote> latest win was at the Planning Commission. They argued that 

        the project does not meet the minimum number of Board of Supervisors’ 

        Policy I-63 criteria for a General Plan Amendment (GPA). A GPA would be 

        required for clustering the houses on less than the minimum lot size required 

        by Ramona’s Community Plan.</blockquote>

	  <blockquote> The tentative map for this project involving 9 dwelling units 

        on 43 acres expired last July. The property is native landscape with steep 

        slopes and riparian area. It is located between the San Pasqual Reservation 

        and the Live Oak Ranch Specific Planning Area (SPA) in Valley Center.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>The tentative map should never have been approved in the first 

        place. Under proper planning and conservation biology tenets, this property 

        should be used as a compatible-use area to buffer the natural wildlife 

        areas of the Reservation from the enormous impacts of the neighboring 

        SPA.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>The proponent, the owner of the Live Oak Ranch SPA, has applied 

        for renewal of the map. The County plans to process the application at 

        an administrative rather than public hearing. Public comments are due 

        by 4 December 2000. This appears to be an attempt by the County to remove 

        public participation from the decision-making process in order to placate 

        development interests. </blockquote>
