      <p align="center"><strong>San Diego County General Plan 2020</strong></p>

      <p>As San Diego County&#8217;s General Plan Update takes shape, San Diego 

        County's Board of Supervisors has an obligation to accommodate population 

        growth and influence its distribution in order to protect and use scarce 

        resources wisely; preserve the natural environment; and promote the economic 

        and social welfare of the region. These laudable goals are nothing new. 

        They are part of San Diego County&#8217;s existing General Plan, adopted 

        in 1979. What is new is an attempt by county planners and their allies 

        in the private sector to move away from the goals and policies established 

        in the old plan (based on regional resource categories) toward adoption 

        of an entirely new set of goals and planning criteria based on population 

        density, which will erase urban limit lines and &#8220;country-town&#8221; 

        growth boundaries, putting the protection of &#8220;scarce resources&#8221; 

        and the &#8220;rural character&#8221; of the backcountry in serious doubt.</p>

      <p></p>

      <p>It&#8217;s important that the board recognizes that the goals and policies 

        of the original plan need no improvement. Rather, it&#8217;s their responsible 

        implementation that should be the central concern of the county&#8217;s 

        update effort.</p>

      <p></p>

      <p>Regrettably, the county is allowing misinformation about the current 

        plan to undermine the planning process. Many people apparently believe 

        that the county now favors a planned reduction in population density for 

        the unincorporated areas of the county from approximately 855,000, when 

        in fact the 855,000 is a rogue figure from an earlier and invalid county 

        proposal, not from the current plan. Nonetheless, the density deception 

        has shifted the public focus away from regional resource categories toward 

        density-based goals and policies.</p>

      <p></p>

      <p>In our view, the county must not abandon the sensible goals and policies 

        approved (and legally adopted) twenty years ago for the &quot;economic 

        and social welfare of our region.&quot; Twice the county has tried to 

        cater to special economic interests in its efforts to rezone almost 200,000 

        acres of backcountry agricultural, watershed and ranchlands in its GPA 

        96-03 amendment, and twice a judge has rejected its feeble (and unlawful) 

        product.</p>

      <p></p>

      <p>It's time for the supervisors to find the courage to put the interests 

        and welfare of county residents before the economic self-interest of absentee 

        landowners, investment trusts, and developers by rejecting population-based 

        planning. Regional, resource-based planning, with clearly defined urban 

        growth boundaries and commensurate zoning, is the key to a sustainable 

        future that lives up to the goals of the original plan and gives the supervisors 

        a true claim to public service.<br>
