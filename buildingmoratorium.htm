    <TD> <p><br>

        By Doug Bell </p>

      <p>September 21, 2000 </p>

      <p>&quot;What is required is that the county make a good-faith effort to 

        go afoot and afield in San Diego and come back with a reasonable assessment 

        of what the county stands to lose as a result of the project.&quot; </p>

      <p>So said Superior Court Judge Judith McConnell in handing the County of 

        San Diego its latest failing grade for ignoring state law and proposing 

        to rezone 191,000 acres of rural open space without adequate environmental 

        review. </p>

      <p>It was a gentle rebuke, considering the judge and county residents had 

        been waiting five years for the county to comply with her earlier, nearly 

        identical ruling in 1996. But repeat offenders at the county Planning 

        Department and the Board of Supervisors put the order on hold, finally 

        turning to attorneys, not scientists, to make their case in court. They 

        argued that, while, yes, there would be significant impacts under the 

        new plan (GPA 96-03), there was no way of knowing what those impacts might 

        be since, lacking a crystal ball, they could not predict the future. </p>

      <p>Following this logic, the county could close the Sheriff's Department 

        for lack of specific knowledge of future crimes. </p>

      <p>Undone completely in this stunning display of legal delinquency and hubris 

        are the &quot;smart growth&quot; pretensions of the county Board of Supervisors 

        which, having failed once before to follow state environmental law, and 

        having rejected (and illegally campaigned against) Proposition B (the 

        1998 Rural Heritage and Watershed Initiative), now finds itself -- environmentally 

        speaking -- called out on strikes. </p>

      <p>But there is an equally important test of the supervisors' &quot;good 

        faith efforts&quot; and smart growth fidelity ahead: General Plan 2020. 

        Due to be adopted soon by the Board of Supervisors, GP 2020 sets land-use 

        priorities and restrictions for the next 20 years. The challenge facing 

        the supervisors is to hold off on approving any interim construction that 

        might conflict with the new plan by declaring a moratorium on all such 

        new development until GP 2020 is adopted. </p>

      <p>The reasons why a moratorium is necessary are the hundreds of &quot;vested&quot; 

        commercial and residential projects already in the planning pipeline that 

        stand a good chance of being approved whether or not they conform to GP 

        2020. These projects, which would litter the backcountry with big box 

        retail stores, supermarkets and housing tracts, only continue the pattern 

        of urban sprawl while undermining any smart growth principles contained 

        in GP 2020. The impact of these projects on our county's natural resources 

        would be devastating. </p>

      <p>California Government Code section 65858 authorizes city or county government 

        to suspend the issuance of building permits while it is in the process 

        of updating its general plan. Such an interim ordinance, adopted recently 

        by local governments in Tiburon, San Juan Capistrano and Sutter and Orange 

        counties, is intended only to prevent conflicts between new development 

        entitlements based on current land use plans and contemplated changes 

        to those plans. In effect, a moratorium would suspend the planned destruction 

        of our backcountry and allow public input to secure, in the words of the 

        ordinance, &quot;the public health, safety and welfare.&quot; </p>

      <p>By imposing a moratorium, the county may begin to address the infrastructural 

        problems related to new, recently approved developments as it formulates 

        strategies to deal with the countywide problems of sewage spills, beach 

        pollution, traffic congestion and water and power distribution. To encourage 

        the Board of Supervisors to make the necessary findings pursuant to such 

        an ordinance, Save Our Forest and Ranchlands has invited local planning 

        and sponsor groups to call on the supervisors to suspend the issuance 

        of permits until GP 2020 is adopted. </p>

      <p>In light of the court order to &quot;reasonably assess&quot; the environmental 

        impacts of GPA 96-03 before any such plan is legally adopted, we would 

        ask that the Board of Supervisors also apply Judge McConnell's logic to 

        GP 2020. With no valid reason not to introduce a building moratorium and 

        ample legal precedent to do so, it is the only way to protect what we've 

        got before it's gone and a way for the county to prove to the public it 

        knows something about smart growth after all. </p>
