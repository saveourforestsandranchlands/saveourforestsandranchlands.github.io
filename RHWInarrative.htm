        <strong>How the County of San Diego Killed the Rural Heritage and Watershed 

        Initiative</strong></p>

      <p>The citizens of San Diego have, as all Americans do, an inherent right 

        to a free and true democratic government, properly conducted elections, 

        and political representatives unwaveringly committed to the rules of local 

        legislature. Attempts to thwart important citizens' initiatives punch 

        a hole in this system, especially where the source of the problem lies 

        within the walls of the citizens' own representatives. This is a case 

        about repeated campaigns to sway public opinion against a citizens' initiative 

        as it headed for the ballot box - attempts which were often blatant, occasionally 

        covert, and always illegal. The Rural Heritage and Watershed Initiative 

        (&quot;Initiative&quot;) was a proposed comprehensive land-use statute 

        supported by a broad coalition of concerned citizens, planning and conservation 

        experts, land owners, and political leaders. If adopted, the Initiative 

        would have amended the San Diego County General Plan by establishing an 

        urban-rural boundary. The boundary was intended to protect the region's 

        backcountry from inappropriate development and uncontrolled urban and 

        suburban sprawl. The Rural Heritage and Watershed Initiative Committee 

        (RHWIC) was created to assist in the passage of the Initiative.</p>

      <p> Following is the story of how, in the course one year's time, the County 

        committed numerous acts of illegal electioneering, and thereby, succeeding 

        in killing the Rural Heritage and Watershed Initiative.</p>

      <p><strong>Chapter 1<br>

        The Letter</strong></p>

      <p>The RHWI was unveiled to the public during the fall of 1997. In December 

        of that year, the San Diego County Board of Supervisors authorized County 

        staff to spend $50,000 to conduct a study of the financial, environmental 

        and planning impacts of the Initiative. To gather information for the 

        report, on January 16, 1998, the San Diego County Department of Planning 

        and Land Use sent out copies of a letter to fire protection, school, water, 

        and sanitation districts requesting comments on the expected impacts of 

        the RHWI.</p>

      <p> Unfortunately, this memorandum of inquiry was premised on the foregone 

        conclusion that the RHWI would have a similarly negative effect in every 

        district. The memorandum stated: &quot;The Initiative would decrease land 

        use densities in your district's service area. This is expected to result 

        in larger parcel sizes in many areas at build-out and a lower population 

        within your district.&quot;</p>

      <p> A number of districts contained very little or no land affected by the 

        Initiative, and therefore it has been opined that County's allegation 

        that each would experience such a reduction in density or population under 

        the Initiative was intentionally deceptive. While purported to solicit 

        information on the impacts of the Initiative, the letter was clearly an 

        attempt to draw negative reactions. Some rural leaders agreed. On January 

        29, Joe S. Jackson, assistant general manager of the Fallbrook Public 

        Utility District, wrote the County, &quot;I find the questions . . . intentionally 

        leading or misleading,&quot; and dismissed the idea that the Initiative 

        would hurt his rural district. Remarkably, after significant political 

        pressure, the district was forced to withdraw its comment letter and issued 

        a more generic response. When viewed in conjunction with the events that 

        followed, without a doubt, the solicitation of comments by the County 

        was intended solely to find any possible examples of negative impacts, 

        no matter how illogical or inapplicable, and was not aimed at discerning 

        both the positive and negative sides of the issue.</p>

      <p> <strong>Chapter 2<br>

        The Legislation</strong></p>

      <p>Soon thereafter, on February 11, 1998, the Board of Supervisors gave 

        a clear indication of its desire to impede the traditional initiative 

        process with the RHWI. In a 4-1 vote, the Board directed the Chief Administrative 

        Officer to, &quot;seek and work aggressively for the passage of urgency 

        [State] legislation which would permit only the registered voters of the 

        unincorporated area the right to vote on General Plan and zoning initiatives 

      </p>

      <p>that only affect the unincorporated area.&quot; The arrogance with which 

        the County attempted to disenfranchise the majority of County voters was 

        profoundly felt by the RHWIC, as the proposal actually stated on its face 

        that the RHWI was the impetus for the request. The Board's rationale for 

        the legislation was that the Initiative would only affect the unincorporated 

        areas, and it would be unfair for the residents of the incorporated municipalities 

        to decide the fate of those outside the cities.</p>

      <p> To put it mildly, the legislation died before it got off the ground. 

        Whether because the Board suddenly realized that the effects of the RHWI 

        would be felt by citizens throughout the entire County, or more likely, 

        because it was tipped off that such legislation would ultimately prove 

        unconstitutional, the County was totally unable to gather support locally 

        or at the state level.</p>

      <p> Regardless of underlying intent, the proposal clearly shows that at 

        least some members of the Board were taking steps in opposition to the 

        Initiative from the beginning. In fact, Supervisor Ron Roberts opposed 

        seeking urgency legislation because, &quot;To do so&quot;, he said, &quot;would 

        make it look as though the board was directly targeting the Rural Heritage 

        and Watershed Initiative before the County had completed an analysis of 

        the measure and taken a position.&quot; </p>

      <p> State Senator David Kelley, R-37th, went even further: &quot;The Legislature 

        would not look favorably anyway on a bill that seeks to subvert the will 

        of the people preparing an initiative. This effort could easily be construed 

        as an attempt to shortstop the rural heritage initiative.&quot;</p>

      <p> From the Union, February 15, 1998 edition: </p>

      <p>&quot; . . . the San Diego Board of Supervisors' efforts to stop a countywide 

        vote on the measure is certainly a bad idea . . .. Supervisor Dianne Jacob 

        insisted that the vote had nothing to do with the rural heritage measure. 

      </p>

      <p> That's hard to believe. </p>

      <p> The vote was a request to Sacramento for urgency state legislation; 

        it was clearly designed to keep off the countywide ballot the measure 

        that would limit development on agricultural lands in the eastern two-thirds 

        of the county. </p>

      <p> From the League of Women Voters:</p>

      <p>&quot;There are . . . governmental matters in the San Diego region which 

        go beyond single jurisdictions or concern more than one agency or general-purpose 

        government. The League of Women Voters of San Diego County therefore opposes 

        this act which was proposed specifically to undercut the Rural Heritage 

        &amp; Watershed Initiative, which we support.&quot;</p>

      <p> From the City of Del Mar, Mayor Mark Whitehead:</p>

      <p>&quot;Why would the San Diego County Board of Supervisors be willing 

        to deny 84% of the citizens of this County, residents of incorporated 

        areas, the right to vote on County-wide issues that will directly impact 

        all of us. It is Del Mar's hope that you will re-consider your decision 

        of February 11, 1998 to introduce this State legislation that limits the 

        vast majority of YOUR CONSTITUENTS' right to vote on major issues that 

        affect all of us.&quot;</p>

      <p> From the City of Poway, then mayor Don Higginson:</p>

      <p>&quot; . . . it is difficult to accept that this elected body would seek 

        to disenfranchise 84 percent of their constituents.&quot; </p>

      <p> And, finally, from the Descanso Sponsor Group:</p>

      <p>&quot;It appears that the Board of Supervisors wants to keep their own 

        authority over land use in the rural areas, but eliminate the constitutional 

        rights of city voters . . .. this Act will subvert the democratic process.&quot; 

      </p>

      <p><br>

        Ultimately, though the Board's proposal never took hold, certain Supervisors 

        could not hold back their disdain for the Initiative. Supervisor Bill 

        Horn, in particular, openly and vehemently made statements in opposition 

        to the RHWI at this time, calling the Initiative &quot;a crime.&quot; 

        While a Supervisor cannot be faulted for having an opinion and speaking 

        his mind, when the opinion becomes covert County policy, paid for with 

        taxpayer's funds, something must be done.</p>

      <p></p>

      <p><strong>Chapter 3<br>

        The Report</strong></p>

      <p>Pursuant to California Elections Code &cent;&yen; 9111, a county is authorized 

        to refer a proposed initiative to any county agency for a report on the 

        initiative's fiscal impact, its effect on the internal consistency of 

        the county's general and specific plans, and any other matter the board 

        of supervisors requests to be in the report. The county's role under such 

        circumstances is purely informational and ministerial in nature and cannot 

        be biased in favor of or against an initiative measure. </p>

      <p> Pursuant to a directive issued in December the year prior, in April 

        1998, the San Diego Department of Planning and Land Use issued a scathingly 

        biased report to the Board of Supervisors in violation of California Elections 

        Code &cent;&yen; 9111. Importantly, not only was the report itself tainted 

        with bias against the Initiative, the act of presenting the report to 

        the Board was even more so. While the report purported to analyze the 

        Initiative in an impartial and independent manner pursuant to the Elections 

        Code, upon closer inspection, it contained far too many misleading statements 

        to be purely &quot;informational and unbiased.&quot; </p>

      <p> For example, the Executive Summary of the final report contains the 

        following statement: &quot;Individual property owners in affected areas 

        will be hardest hit due to reduced land values due to loss of development 

        potential for 54,133 dwelling units which will have a negative impact 

        on mortgage funds.&quot; (Emphasis added) This statement implies that 

        &quot;development potential&quot; is a property right being taken away. 

        As a takings issue, the Initiative does not limit the ability of property 

        owners to make an economically viable use of their property, which is 

        the appropriate legal standard. The report completely fails to mention 

        any of the numerous existing forms of government regulation, which currently 

        impose limits on abilities of property owners to make the most profitable 

        use of their property. Further, the ability of farmers to borrow as much 

        against their land as they could have borrowed prior to &quot;the loss 

        of development potential&quot; skirts the issue of true impact to agriculture. 

        A farmer is a farmer; a developer is a developer.</p>

      <p> Also note the use of patently judgmental strong language. For instance, 

        the phrase &quot;hardest hit&quot; clearly reflects an adverse predisposition 

        by the County. Similarly, the County negatively portrays one of the greatest 

        benefits of the Initiative- more effective allocation of infrastructure 

        costs- by skewing semantics. The statement in the report, &quot;The primary 

        fiscal effect will be the need to shift public funds, especially infrastructure 

        improvements, from the rural areas to the urban areas,&quot; is given 

        a negative connotation when followed by allegations that this shift will 

        be &quot;to accommodate higher population growth pressure in those areas. 

        The added growth pressure in the urban parts of the County will tend to 

        refocus spending away from rural areas.&quot;</p>

      <p>(Emphasis added). </p>

      <p> Numerous documents, including the County's General Plan itself, extol 

        the virtues of placing new growth into existing urban areas and allocating 

        funds to regenerate urban core infrastructure. The County planners/report 

        writers were certainly aware of these documents and the values they contain. 

        Therefore, the way the County takes what is essentially good news, and 

        makes it sound bad, that's intentional bias coming through.</p>

      <p>The report's Executive Summary also states, &quot;The initiative circumvents 

        the planning process and eliminates the ability of community planning 

        and sponsor groups and the public to evaluate and determine land use patterns.&quot; 

        Initiatives are not only constitutional, they are considered one of the 

        most cherished rights of California citizens. The RHWI was signed by more 

        than 100,000 San Diego County residents, and was supported by nearly 50 

        Members of 14 County Planning/Sponsor Groups. The disdain espoused by 

        the County for such &quot;ballot box zoning&quot; was nothing more than 

        an ego- driven reaction to the loss of power and control currently enjoyed 

        by the developer-friendly County administration. </p>

      <p> The Report also notes:</p>

      <p>&quot;The general effect of the Initiative is to shift the location of 

        impacts of growth rather than to avoid impacts . . . A reduction in the 

        number of dwelling units accommodated in community and subregional plans 

        by 54,133 units will constrain the market and add pressure on cities to 

        upzone their neighborhoods. Urban areas can expect a greater rate and 

        intensity of development as market pressure encourages buildout at full 

        or increased density.&quot; </p>

      <p> These statements imply an extremely heavy impact on non-RHWI areas, 

        which is an exaggeration of the truth. Notably, the analysis implies that 

        all units will be built by 2020. According to SANDAG, however, if development 

        on RHWI land were to continue at the same rate it has for the past 20 

        years, it would take 100 years to build out the 54,000 units at issue. 

        This 80-year discrepancy is a significant flaw within the County's analysis 

        and portrayal of the Initiative.</p>

      <p> Also important is that the report makes no mention of the real cause 

        of development pressures in the region- the 406,000 units that will be 

        required to accommodate the 1.1 million additional people expected by 

        2020- regardless of the measly 54,000 units lost in the RHWI areas. This 

        is what will truly: 1) put growth pressure on sensitive lands; 2) add 

        to the regional need for new sources of drinking water; 3) make urban 

        intersections worse; and 4) escalate land costs far worse than the RHWI 

        ever could.</p>

      <p> The Report goes on, &quot;Since the measure only constrains parcel sizes, 

        not land uses on the parcels, it offers no assurances that any environmental 

        resources will be protected.&quot; This statement is also misleading in 

        that it implies a change in parcel size will not provide any protection 

        for environmental resources and only a change in land use will achieve 

        such a result. This argument diminishes the approach taken by the RHWI 

        and implies that the Initiative is misdirected. The report tries to invalidate 

        the mechanism of the RHWI by saying that it cannot achieve its intended 

        effect- the protection of rural farmland and regional watersheds- without 

        also addressing every other environmental issue. However, the RHWI was 

        based on the premise that existing land uses on large parcels are basically 

        O.K., and that small parcels are the weak link leading to development, 

        and thereby loss of environmental resources. In essence, the statement 

        presupposes intent to replace existing environmental regulations with 

        a single land-use designation, and this simply was not the case.</p>

      <p> The Report states, &quot; . . . impacted land varies in actual sensitivity, 

        including many areas that are not environmentally sensitive.&quot; Contrary 

        to the report's assumption, the Initiative never purported to say that 

        all RHWI lands are environmentally sensitive. There are many reasons why 

        lands were included in the Initiative, and by making statements like this, 

        the report again shifts basic assumptions so that it further appears the 

        Initiative wont accomplish its intended result. </p>

      <p> The report states, &quot;60 percent of the pre-approved habitat core 

        areas (under MSCP) are not protected by the initiative, so growth pressure 

        on those sensitive lands will be intensified.&quot; The analysis of the 

        impact of the RHWI on the MSCP is perhaps the greatest farce of all. It 

        is totally irrelevant whether the RHWI incorporates or covers the MSCP 

        reserve lands. It never purported to do so. Rather, it was meant to fill 

        in the gaps left by poor MSCP planning. The idea that there will be intensified 

        pressure on MSCP lands completely overlooks the benefit of habitat continuity 

        that would occur with the two programs working together. By invoking this 

        kind of scare tactic, it is as though the County took a decided stance 

        that the RHWIC was trying to come up with a new habitat conservation system 

        and decided to nip that possibility in the bud right from the start. Quite 

        simply, the County never sought to understand either the true intent or 

        the true impact of the RHWI.</p>

      <p><strong>Chapter 4<br>

        The Presentation </strong></p>

      <p>If the Report itself is not a clear indication of the County's bias, 

        taken in the context of the following, it should be. On May 6, 1998, County 

        staff presented a summary and interpretation of the report to the Board 

        of Supervisors. During this publicly televised debacle, City planner Rose 

        Garduno delivered to the Board a presentation easily as misleading, and 

        even more biased, than the Report itself. The Supervisors interrupted 

        her with perfectly poised inquiries and, time and again, Garduno answered 

        with rehearsed replies. The entire presentation ran so askew of legally 

        mandated objectivity that Supervisor Dianne Jacob was compelled to chime 

        in at the conclusion to express her feeling that the presentation was 

        extremely negative. Then, in an absurdly rehearsed tone, she asked for 

        assurance that the report was free of staff bias. Planning Director Gary 

        Pryor stepped up to the plate. </p>

      <p> Pryor calmly explained that, in his mind, the report was a simple application 

        of SANDAG statistics to the proposed Initiative. Yet, several minutes 

        later, Supervisor Bill Horn assured all present that, while the Board 

        as an entity is prohibited from exhibiting bias, he himself hated the 

        Initiative. And then he called the RHWI a &quot;fraud.&quot; Earlier Supervisor 

        Horn called the chairman of the RHWIC, Duncan McFetridge, a &quot;hypocrite&quot; 

        for failing to conduct an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for the Initiative, 

        knowing full well that citizen proponents of an initiative measure have 

        absolutely no legal obligation to provide a local government with an Environmental 

        Impact Report prior to passage. Horn continued his personal assault by 

        expressing disbelief that McFetridge had the nerve to sue the County for 

        past failures to conduct proper EIRs when he himself had not prepared 

        one for the RHWI. </p>

      <p> As many times as the Supervisors insisted they had not yet made up their 

        minds on the Initiative, the truth was clear. Supervisor Horn had hated 

        the proposal for months (as he stated without hesitation), Supervisor 

        Roberts had misgivings about the impact report but opposed the RHWI anyway, 

        Supervisor Slater was openly disgusted with Duncan McFetridge, and Supervisor 

        Jacob rather conspicuously sought repeated assurances that the Board didn't 

        appear biased. The entire three-hour meeting was a sham and everyone in 

        attendance knew it. Several members of the audience said so. Legally, 

        the meeting also served as a direct broadcast of bias from County staff 

        and the Board to the public. </p>

      <p><strong>Chapter 5<br>

        The Article</strong></p>

      <p>On June 7, 1998, Jim Gogek, a writer for the San Diego Union-Tribune 

        Newspaper, authored an opinion article entitled, &quot;Battling the Rural 

        Heritage Initiative.&quot; In this article, Mr. Gogek conveyed allegations 

        of illegal bias by County officials and staff in the production and presentation 

        of the Initiative impact report. He identified Lawrence B. Prior III, 

        Chief Administrative Officer of the County of San Diego, and Gary Pryor, 

        Head of the County's Department of Planning and Land Use, as the individuals 

        who orchestrated a series of staff meetings designed to exaggerate the 

        negative aspects of the Initiative. About the Board meeting that took 

        place on May 6, he wrote:</p>

      <p> &quot;[Planning Director Gary] Pryor knew exactly what conclusions he 

        wanted from his planners, and he made sure they were reached. So did [Lawrence] 

        Prior, the county's top manager. After a dress rehearsal of the report's 

        presentation, he indicated he wanted a stronger negative message before 

        it went to the supervisors. </p>

      <p> So when planner Rose Garduno presented the report to the Board of Supervisors, 

        she delivered broadside after broadside. And worst of all . . .' she would 

        say, and then launch into another litany of the initiative's supposed 

        evils. Meanwhile, supervisors interrupted on cue with prepared questions 

        designed to exaggerate the already skewed statistics. The whole thing 

        was a joke.&quot; </p>

      <p> Mr. Gogek concludes his article by stating, &quot;[w]hat the county 

        board and staff are doing is campaigning against the rural heritage initiative. 

        And that's illegal.&quot;</p>

      <p><strong>Chapter 6<br>

        The Public Records Act Request</strong></p>

      <p>On July 3, 1998, the RHWIC, through its attorneys, filed a request under 

        the California Public Records Act (PRA) to gain access to documents which 

        it believed would likely expose the illegal activities by Prior, Pryor, 

        and other County staff mentioned in the newspaper article. Among other 

        things, the RHWIC specifically requested access to public records pertaining 

        to the following areas:</p>

      <p> Communications between County employees for the purpose of presenting 

        the Report to the Board of Supervisors, including but not limited to any 

        directives by CAO Larry Prior to emphasize the negative impacts of the 

        RHWI; </p>

      <p> Communications among County employees regarding any newspaper article 

        written on the RHWI; and, </p>

      <p>All records regarding the expenditure of the $50,000 allotted for the 

        creation of the Report. </p>

      <p>On July 23, 1998, Marco Gonzalez, attorney for RHWIC, reviewed files 

        compiled by the County pursuant to the request. During this review, Mr. 

        Gonzalez discovered numerous emails that indicated that County and the 

        Board of Supervisors' staffs had been seeking a way to keep the Rural 

        Heritage and Watershed Initiative from being included on the November 

        ballot. These correspondences contain such statements as, &quot;If the 

        RHWI does not come back before August 7, then Duncan (McFetridge, the 

        RHWIC Chairman) would have to pay for a special election!&quot; The punctuation 

        reflects the County's attitude toward the Initiative. Ultimately, the 

        threat of lawsuit and the PRA request made it clear that the RHWIC would 

        not stand for such blatant politicking, and the County abandoned ideas 

        of keeping the measure off the ballot.</p>

      <p> The most controversial document seen by Mr. Gonzalez during the PRA 

        file review was a photocopy reproduction of the Union's newspaper article 

        alleging biased County actions. At the top, left-hand corner of the document 

        were various handwritten notes expressing: (1) surprise that the RHWIC 

        Chairman, Duncan McFetridge, had knowledge of a dress rehearsal of the 

        Report's presentation to the Board of Supervisors referred to in the article; 

        and (2) the author's opinion that the damaging information in the article 

        must have been leaked to the press from a staff member of the County. 

        In other words, the handwritten notes supported the allegations contained 

        in the article.</p>

      <p> Mr. Gonzalez tabbed the document, along with others, for reproduction 

        by the </p>

      <p>County as is standard during such a file review. On July 29, 1998, the 

        County informed the RHWIC that it would not produce the document with 

        a copy of the margin notes previously disclosed because they were now 

        suddenly exempt from disclosure as &quot;deliberative privilege material&quot;. 

        A photocopy reproduction of the newspaper article was produced with the 

        margin notes whited out. </p>

      <p> Inflamed that the County would endorse such a post-hoc rationalization 

        for withholding a document already disclosed to the public, the RHWIC 

        on July 31, 1998 informed the County it was not satisfied with the documents 

        which were produced. Furthermore, a privilege log of all documents withheld 

        was demanded for the purpose of evaluating every privilege alleged. The 

        privilege log produced by the County on August 26, 1998 noted additional 

        documents withheld from disclosure due to the &quot;deliberative process 

        privilege.&quot; </p>

      <p> For each of these documents, the County claimed exemption under California 

        Government Code section 6254(a) and 6255. Under both of these sections, 

        a public record may only be withheld when the public interest in withholding 

        the record clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure. Despite 

        the express mandate that this balancing test is made, at no time did the 

        County provide any justification beyond a vaguely articulated desire to 

        keep County business beyond the reach of public interference. </p>

      <p> The position of the RHWIC, however, was that no matter how crucial to 

        the democratic process, local government's freedom to operate with minimum 

        interference was clearly outweighed because of the overwhelming public 

        interest served by exposing high-ranking government officials condoning 

        the use of public funds to finance illegal electioneering.</p>

      <p> The RHWIC sought these documents in order to ensure that San Diego County 

        residents' tax money has not been, and will not in the future be, spent 

        on illegal campaign efforts in opposition to citizens' initiative measures.</p>

      <p> On or about September 3, 1998, the RHWIC notified the County it was 

        still not satisfied with the County's response for two reasons: 1) the 

        balancing test requirement had not been met; and, 2) any alleged right 

        to withhold the document with handwritten notes was waived upon inadvertent 

        disclosure to Mr. Gonzalez. The County did not respond further to the 

        RHWIC's letters.</p>

      <p><strong>Chapter 7<br>

        The Election</strong></p>

      <p>The Rural Heritage and Watershed Initiative designated &quot;Proposition 

        B&quot; in the November 1998 election did not pass. The San Diego County 

        Farm Bureau, supported significantly by the building industry, real estate 

        industry, and groups such as Citizens for Private Property Rights, mounted 

        a significant media campaign against Proposition B. Additionally, numerous 

        events took place during this period which reflected the County's bias 

        against Prop. B, and contributed to its defeat.</p>

      <p> First, the Chief of Staff for Supervisor Ron Roberts, Steve Dannon, 

        took a temporary leave of absence from his position as a County employee 

        to work for the public relations firm hired by the opponents of Proposition 

        B. Additionally, Supervisor Slater became a signatory on the ballot arguments 

        in opposition to Proposition B. Finally, senior planner Rose Garduno of 

        the County's Department of Planning and Land Use participated on behalf 

        of the County in numerous speaking engagements against Prop. B in front 

        of such groups as chambers of commerce and realtor's associations.</p>

      <p> In September 1998, approximately one month prior to the election, a 

        report was produced by Strong Associates of Oakland, California entitled, 

        &quot;An Analysis of Land Use, Fiscal, Transportation, Environmental, 

        and Health Impacts of the Rural Heritage and Watershed Initiative.&quot; 

        (&quot;Strong Report&quot;) The Strong Report was an independent, unbiased 

        analysis commissioned by the Alliance Healthcare Foundation of San Diego. 

        The report concluded that the RHWI would have beneficial impacts including:</p>

      <p> Preservation of 578,000 acres of sparsely developed land for open space 

        and </p>

      <p>farming rather than eventual rural residential use;</p>

      <p> Savings estimated at $25.2 million annually in local public service 

        costs; </p>

      <p> Shift in future housing closer to destinations and to areas better served 

        by<br>

        transportation corridors and alternative transit; </p>

      <p> Reduction in County-wide vehicle miles traveled by 7.4 million miles 

        daily </p>

      <p>(approximately 6% reduction). The Initiative would also reduce average 

        commute time for all future County residents by as much as 12%;</p>

      <p> Reduction in County-wide air pollutants from vehicle emissions by 4%-6%; 

        and, </p>

      <p> Minimization of development disturbances to affected watersheds. </p>

      <p> Amazingly, immediately following the issuance of the Strong Report, 

        with the election looming in the near future, the County scrambled to 

        create a document entitled, &quot;An Analysis of the Strong Associates' 

        Report on the Rural Heritage and Watershed Initiative&quot; (&quot;Strong 

        Report Analysis&quot;). By the tone and timing of this document, it was 

        clear that the County was doing everything in its power to debunk any 

        conclusion of beneficial impact noted in the Strong Report. Further, though 

        it was produced at the direction of the County Board of Supervisors, by 

        staff paid with taxpayer funds, when counsel for the RHWIC sought a copy 

        of the Strong Report Analysis, he was referred to the San Diego County 

        Farm Bureau because all of the County's files &quot;had been purged.&quot; 

        Because the Farm Bureau is a private entity who openly campaigned against 

        the passage of Proposition B, the RHWIC was justifiably outraged.</p>

      <p><strong>Chapter 8<br>

        The Lawsuit</strong></p>

      <p>Following the election defeat, on December 8, 1998, the RHWIC filed a 

        lawsuit against the County seeking injunctive relief for violations of 

        the California Public Records Act. The Committee specifically sought disclosure 

        of the handwritten notes on the photocopy of the newspaper article and 

        all of the documents listed in the County's privilege log.</p>

      <p> Throughout 1999, the County vehemently opposed the release of any of 

        the allegedly privileged documents. Some interesting points came out during 

        the litigation:</p>

      <p>1. Faced with the mandate to identify the author of the handwritten notes 

        on the withheld copy of the Gogek article, the County first stated that 

        it was unable to identify the author of the handwritten notes. Subsequently, 

        after months of repeated denials and unwarranted delay, the County admitted 

        that the handwritten notes were authored by Planning Director Gary Pryor 

        during a telephone conversation with CAO Larry Prior. The County further 

        admitted the purpose of the notes was an investigation into staff leaks 

        regarding the RHWI presentation preparation. Remarkably, in early August 

        of 1999, the County retracted this admission and stated, once again, that 

        it had no idea who wrote the notes. Ultimately, the court agreed with 

        the RHWIC, and ruled that the county had waived any applicable deliberative 

        process privilege for the handwritten notes. Once disclosed, the handwritten 

        notes did in fact portray disdain by the CAO that the information had 

        been &quot;leaked&quot; beyond County staff. . Specifically, they stated: 

        &quot;Larry's Comments</p>

      <p>* LPIII believes it was leaked by staff</p>

      <p>* We have a problem! Info re: meeting not accurate</p>

      <p>* We have someone on the McFetridge team</p>

      <p>* How would Gogek have known about the pre-meeting</p>

      <p>* Does Gary have any idea&quot;</p>

      <p>(Emphasis added) </p>

      <p>Taken in the context of the accusations in the article, these statements 

        go far in supporting the position of the RHWIC.</p>

      <p> 2. Following the ruling on the handwritten notes, the County identified 

        a total of 43 allegedly privileged documents. Somewhat surprisingly, after 

        the RHWIC submitted its trial brief, the County agreed to disclose 38 

        of these remaining 43 documents (with allegedly irrelevant portions redacted). 

        Because the redacted portions were often interspersed with fragments of 

        information regarding the Initiative, the RHWIC requested the Court take 

        extra care to ensure all relevant information was produced. Ultimately, 

        the Court did find additional information that should have been disclosed.</p>

      <p><br>

        3. The newly acquired documents both supported the RHWIC's case, and raised 

        additional new questions. The documents supported the fact that a dress 

        rehearsal of the presentation to the supervisors did, in fact, take place. 

        They also showed that Planning Department staff was directed by Gary Pryor 

        to solicit important land-value information from the Building Industry 

        Association, a group vocally opposed to the Initiative. Further, there 

        was reference to an Initiative with a bias against it.</p>

      <p><br>

        4. Four of the five remaining documents were ultimately ordered disclosed 

        in the suit. Among other things, these documents reflected notes and questions 

        scripted by Board of Supervisor staff in anticipation of public hearings. 

        Taken cumulatively, these further the RHWIC assertions that the Supervisors 

        were predisposed to forcing the Initiative's failure all along.</p>

      <p><strong>Final Chapter<br>

        Initiative Election Bias and The Law</strong></p>

      <p>Case law on improper expenditures of public funds for a partisan purpose 

        distinguishes between two types of government action: (1) legislative 

        lobbying and/or outright election campaigning for a particular candidate 

        or issue, and; (2) informational services that are potentially biased. 

        The first category is not applicable to the situation presented here because 

        the actions of the Board did not amount to an instance of clear-cut public 

        advocacy against the RHWI- i.e., the Board did not stamp a blatant message 

        on the cover of the report such as, &quot;VOTE NO ON THE RURAL HERITAGE 

        AND WATERSHED INITIATIVE.&quot; However, the Board and County staff's 

        actions suggest a more covert, yet equally pungent, attempt to influence 

        public opinion. The second category noted above clearly is applicable. 

        Based on the direct and circumstantial evidence noted herein, County's 

        adverse position to the Rural Heritage and Watershed Initiative was made 

        clear to all involved. Because the County utilized taxpayer funds to convey 

        only a negative image of the RHWI, and did not accurately represent the 

        likely beneficial impacts to the citizenry and the environment with passage 

        of the Initiative, the law was broken. To protect the future of all initiative 

        measures in the County of San Diego, the County's illegal activities must 

        be further exposed, and the individual supervisors and staff held accountable.</p>

      <p> On March 14, 2000, the Board of Supervisors agreed to pay approximately 

        $65,000 in attorney's fees for its unwarranted withholding of public documents 

        from the RHWIC.</p>
